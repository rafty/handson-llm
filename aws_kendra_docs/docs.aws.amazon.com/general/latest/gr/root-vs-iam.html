      credentials</em> to verify who you are and whether you have permission to access the
    resources that you are requesting. AWS uses the security credentials to authenticate and
    authorize your requests.</p><p>For example, if you want to download a protected file from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, your
    credentials must allow that access. If your credentials don't show you are authorized to
    download the file, AWS denies your request. However, your AWS security credentials aren't
    required for you to download a file in an Amazon S3 bucket that is publicly shared.</p><p>There are different types of users in AWS. All AWS users have security credentials.
    There is the account owner (root user), users in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), federated users, and
    IAM users.</p><p>Users have either long-term or temporary security credentials. Root user, IAM user,
    and access keys have long-term security credentials that do not expire. To protect long-term
    credentials you can <a href="./id_credentials_access-keys.html">manage and rotate access
      keys</a>, <a href="./id_credentials_passwords.html">change passwords</a>, and <a href="./id_credentials_mfa.html">enable MFA</a>. </p><p>IAM roles, users in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), and federated users have temporary security credentials.
    Temporary security credentials expire after a defined period of time or when the user ends their
    session. Temporary credentials work almost identically to long-term credentials, with the
    following differences:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p>Temporary security credentials are <em>short-term</em>, as the
        name implies. They can be configured to last for anywhere from a few minutes to several
        hours. After the credentials expire, AWS no longer recognizes them or allows any kind of
        access from API requests made with them.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>Temporary security credentials are not stored with the user but are generated
        dynamically and provided to the user when requested. When (or even before) the temporary
        security credentials expire, the user can request new credentials, as long as the user
        requesting them still has permissions to do so.</p>
    </li></ul></div><p>As a result, temporary credentials have the following advantages over long-term
    credentials:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p>You do not have to distribute or embed long-term AWS security credentials with an
        application.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>You can provide access to your AWS resources to users without having to define an
        AWS identity for them. Temporary credentials are the basis for <a href="./id_roles.html">roles and identity federation</a>.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>The temporary security credentials have a limited lifetime, so you do not have to rotate
        them or explicitly revoke them when they're no longer needed. After temporary security
        credentials expire, they cannot be reused. You can specify how long the credentials are
        valid, up to a maximum limit. </p>
    </li></ul></div>
    <h2 id="security-considerations-ref">Security considerations</h2>
    <p>We recommend that you consider the following information when determining the security
      provisions for your AWS account:</p>
     
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
       
       
       
       
            
       
         
        
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p> When you create an AWS account, we create the account root user. The credentials of the
        root user (account owner) allow full access to all resources in the account. The first task you
        perform with the root user is to grant another user administrative permissions to your
        AWS account so that you minimize the usage of the root user. </p></li><li class="listitem">
        <p>You can't use IAM policies to deny the root user access to resources explicitly. You
          can only use an AWS Organizations <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_type-auth.html">service control policy (SCP)</a> to limit the permissions of the root user. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>If you forget or lose your root user password, you must have access to the email address
          associated with your account in order to reset it.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>If you lose your root user access keys, you must be able to sign in to your account as
          the root user to create new ones.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Do not use the root user for your everyday tasks. Use it to perform the tasks that only
          the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the
          root user, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">Tasks that require root user
            credentials</a> in the <em>AWS Account Management Reference Guide</em>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Security credentials are account-specific. If you have access to multiple
          AWS accounts, you have separate credentials for each account.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><a href="./access_policies.html">Policies</a> determine what
        actions a user, role, or member of a user group can perform, on which AWS resources, and
        under what conditions. Using policies you can securely control access to
        AWS services and resources in your AWS account. If you must modify or revoke permissions
        in response to a security event, you delete or modify the policies instead of making changes
        directly to the identity.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Be sure to save the sign-in credentials for your <em>Emergency
              Access</em> IAM user and any access keys you created for programmatic access
            in a secure location. If you lose your access keys, you must sign in to your account to
            create new ones.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>We strongly recommend that you use temporary credentials provides by IAM roles and
            federated users instead of the long-term credentials provided by IAM users and access
            keys.</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      
     
    <h2 id="sec-federated-identity-overview">Federated identity</h2>
    <p>Federated identities are users with external identities that are granted temporary AWS credentials that they can
      use to access secure AWS account resources. External identities can come from a corporate identity store (such as
      LDAP or Windows Active Directory) or from a third party (such as Login in with Amazon,
      Facebook, or Google). Federated identities do not sign in with the AWS Management Console or
      AWS access portal.</p>
    <p>To enable federated identities to sign in to AWS, you must create a custom URL that includes
      <code class="code">https://signin.aws.amazon.com/federation</code>. For more information, see <a href="./id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html">Enabling custom identity broker
      access to the AWS console</a>.</p>
    <p>For more information about federated identities, see <a href="./id_roles_providers.html">Identity providers and federation</a>.</p>
   
    <h2 id="sec-multi-factor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h2>
    <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra level of security for users who can
      access your AWS account. For additional security, we recommend that you require MFA on the
      AWS account root user credentials and all IAM users. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in
        AWS</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
    <p>When you activate MFA and you sign in to your AWS account, you are prompted for your
      sign-in credentials, plus a response generated by an MFA device, such as a code, a touch or
      tap, or a biometric scan. When you add MFA, your AWS account settings and resources are
      more secure.</p>
    <p>By default, MFA isn't activated. You can activate and manage MFA devices for the
      AWS account root user by going to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Security credentials</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> page or the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>IAM</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> dashboard in the AWS Management Console. For more information about activating MFA for
      IAM users, see <a href="./id_credentials_mfa_enable.html">Enabling MFA devices for users in AWS</a>.</p>
    <p>For more information about signing in with multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices,
      see <a href="./console_sign-in-mfa.html">Using MFA devices with your IAM sign-in page</a>.</p>
   
    <h2 id="sec-access-keys-and-secret-access-keys">Programmatic access</h2>
       <p>You provide your AWS access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS or to use the
        AWS Command Line Interface or AWS Tools for PowerShell. We recommend using short-term access keys when possible.</p>
      <p>When you create a long-term access key, you create the access key ID (for example,
        <code class="code">AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE</code>) and secret access key (for example,
        <code class="code">wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY</code>) as a set. The secret access key is available for
        download only when you create it. If you don't download your secret access key or if you
        lose it, you must create a new one.</p>
      <p>In many scenarios, you don't need long-term access keys that never expire (as you have
        when you create access keys for an IAM user). Instead, you can create IAM roles and
        generate temporary security credentials. Temporary security credentials include an access
        key ID and a secret access key, but they also include a security token that indicates when
        the credentials expire. After they expire, they're no longer valid.</p>
      <p>Access key IDs beginning with <code class="code">AKIA</code> are long-term access keys for an IAM
        user or an AWS account root user. Access key IDs beginning with <code class="code">ASIA</code> are
        temporary credentials access keys that you create using AWS STS operations.</p>
      


<p>Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.</p>
    <p>To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options.</p>

      <p>For many common use cases, there are alternatives to long-term access keys. To improve
        your account security, consider the following.</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">

            your application code or in a code repository –</span> Instead, use
            AWS Secrets Manager, or other secrets management solution, so you don't have to hardcode keys in
            plaintext. The application or client can then retrieve secrets when needed. For more
            information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html">What is AWS Secrets Manager?</a> in

            security credentials when possible, rather than long-term access keys. Temporary
            security credentials are more secure because they are not stored with the user but are
            generated dynamically and provided to the user when requested. Temporary security
            credentials have a limited lifetime so you don't have to manage or rotate them.
            Mechanisms that provide temporary access keys include IAM roles or the
            authentication of an IAM Identity Center user. For machines that run outside of AWS you can use

            This eliminates the need to create and manage long-term credentials in IAM. In

            create an instance profile that is attached to an Amazon EC2 instance, you can assign an
            AWS role to the instance and make it available to all of its applications. An
            instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the Amazon EC2

      <h2 id="aws-sec-cred-access-ref">Accessing AWS using your AWS
          credentials</h2>
      <p>AWS requires different types of security credentials, depending on how you access
        AWS and what type of AWS user you are. For example, you use sign-in credentials for the
        AWS Management Console while you use access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS. Also, each identity
        you use, whether it be the account root user, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, an AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) user, or
        a federated identity, has unique credentials within AWS.</p>
