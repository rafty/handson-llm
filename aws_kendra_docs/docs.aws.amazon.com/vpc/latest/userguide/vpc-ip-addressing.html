    <h2 id="vpc-private-ipv4-addresses">Private IPv4 addresses</h2>
    
    <p>Private IPv4 addresses (also referred to as <em>private IP addresses</em> in
            this topic) are not reachable over the internet, and can be used for communication
            between the instances in your VPC. When you launch an instance into a VPC, a primary
            private IP address from the IPv4 address range of the subnet is assigned to the default
            network interface (eth0) of the instance. Each instance is also given a private
            (internal) DNS hostname that resolves to the private IP address of the instance. 
            The hostname can be of two types: resource-based or IP-based. For more information, 
            see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-naming.html">EC2 instance naming</a>. If you
            don't specify a primary private IP address, we select an available IP address in the
            subnet range for you. For more information about network interfaces, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html">Elastic Network Interfaces</a> in the
                <em>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances</em>.</p>
    <p>You can assign additional private IP addresses, known as secondary private IP addresses,
      to instances that are running in a VPC. Unlike a primary private IP address, you can reassign
      a secondary private IP address from one network interface to another. A private IP address
      remains associated with the network interface when the instance is stopped and restarted, and
      is released when the instance is terminated. For more information about primary and secondary
      IP addresses, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html">Multiple IP Addresses</a> in the <em>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances</em>.</p>
    <p>We refer to private IP addresses as the IP addresses that are within the IPv4 CIDR range
      of the VPC. Most VPC IP address ranges fall within the private (non-publicly
      routable) IP address ranges specified in RFC 1918; however, you can use publicly
      routable CIDR blocks for your VPC. Regardless of the IP address range of your VPC,
      we do not support direct access to the internet from your VPC's CIDR block,
      including a publicly-routable CIDR block. You must set up internet access through a
      gateway; for example, an internet gateway, virtual private gateway, a AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection, 
      or AWS Direct Connect.</p>
    <p>We never advertise the IPv4 address range of a subnet to the internet.</p>
   
    <h2 id="vpc-public-ipv4-addresses">Public IPv4 addresses</h2>
    
    <p>All subnets have an attribute that determines whether a network interface created in the
      subnet automatically receives a public IPv4 address (also referred to as a <em>public IP address</em> in this topic). Therefore, when you launch an
      instance into a subnet that has this attribute enabled, a public IP address is assigned to the
      primary network interface (eth0) that's created for the instance. A public IP address is
      mapped to the primary private IP address through network address translation (NAT). </p>
    <p>You can control whether your instance receives a public IP address by doing the following: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Modifying the public IP addressing attribute of your subnet. For more information, see
            <a href="./modify-subnets.html#subnet-public-ip">Modify the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet</a>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enabling or disabling the public IP addressing feature during instance launch, which
          overrides the subnet's public IP addressing attribute.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>A public IP address is assigned from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses; it's not
            associated with your account. When a public IP address is disassociated from your
            instance, it's released back into the pool, and is no longer available for you to use.
            You cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP address. Instead, in certain
            cases, we release the public IP address from your instance, or assign it a new one. For
            more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses">Public
                IP addresses</a> in the <em>Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances</em>.</p>
    <p>If you require a persistent public IP address allocated to your account that can be
            assigned to and removed from instances as you require, use an Elastic IP address
            instead. For more information, see <a href="./vpc-eips.html">Associate Elastic IP addresses with resources in your VPC</a>.</p>
    <p>If your VPC is enabled to support DNS hostnames, each instance that receives a public IP
      address or an Elastic IP address is also given a public DNS hostname. We resolve a public DNS
      hostname to the public IP address of the instance outside the instance network, and to the
      private IP address of the instance from within the instance network. For more information, see
        <a href="./vpc-dns.html">DNS attributes for your VPC</a>.</p>
   
    <h2 id="vpc-ipv6-addresses">IPv6 addresses</h2>
    
    <p>You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets. For more
      information, see <a href="./modify-subnets.html#subnet-associate-ipv6-cidr">Add an IPv6 CIDR block to your subnet</a>.</p>
    <p>Your instance in a VPC receives an IPv6 address if an IPv6 CIDR block is associated with
      your VPC and your subnet, and if one of the following is true:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Your subnet is configured to automatically assign an IPv6 address to the primary
            network interface of an instance during launch.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>You manually assign an IPv6 address to your instance during launch.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>You assign an IPv6 address to your instance after launch.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>You assign an IPv6 address to a network interface in the same subnet, and attach the
            network interface to your instance after launch. </p>
        </li></ul></div>
    <p>When your instance receives an IPv6 address during launch, the address is associated with
      the primary network interface (eth0) of the instance. You can disassociate the IPv6 address
      from the primary network interface. We do not support IPv6 DNS hostnames for your
      instance.</p>
    <p>An IPv6 address persists when you stop and start your instance, and is released when you
      terminate your instance. You cannot reassign an IPv6 address while it's assigned to another
      network interface—you must first unassign it.</p>
    <p>You can assign additional IPv6 addresses to your instance by assigning them to a network
      interface attached to your instance. The number of IPv6 addresses you can assign to a network
      interface, and the number of network interfaces you can attach to an instance varies per
      instance type. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI">IP Addresses Per Network Interface Per
        Instance Type</a> in the <em>Amazon EC2 User Guide</em>.</p>
    <p>IPv6 addresses are globally unique and can be configured to remain private or reachable
      over the Internet. You can control whether instances are reachable via their IPv6 addresses by
      controlling the routing for your subnet, or by using security group and network ACL rules. For
      more information, see <a href="./VPC_Security.html">Internetwork traffic privacy in Amazon VPC</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="vpc-using-own-ip-address">Use your own IP addresses</h2>
        <p>You can bring part or all of your own public IPv4 address range or IPv6 address range
            to your AWS account. You continue to own the address range, but AWS  advertises it on the
            internet by default. After you bring the address range to AWS, it appears in your
            account as an address pool. You can create an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address
            pool, and you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block from your IPv6 address pool with a
            VPC.</p>
