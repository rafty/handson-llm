			<p>To create one or more forwarding rules, perform the following procedure.</p>

			<div class="procedure"><a id="resolver-rules-managing-creating-rules-procedure"></a><h6>To create forwarding rules and

			<h2 id="add-reverse-lookup">Adding rules for reverse lookup</h2>
			<p>If you need to control reverse lookups in your VPC, you can add rules to your outbound
				resolver endpoint.</p>
			<div class="procedure"><h6>To create the reverse lookup rule</h6><ol><li>
					<p>Follow the steps in the previous procedure, up to step 5.</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>When you specify your rule, enter the
						PTR
						record for the IP address or addresses that you want a reverse lookup
						forwarding rule for.</p>
					<p>For example, if you need to forward lookups for addresses in the
						10.0.0.0/23 range, enter two rules:</p>
					<div class="itemizedlist">
						 
						 
					<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							<p>0.0.10.in-addr.arpa</p>
						</li><li class="listitem">
							<p>1.0.10.in-addr.arpa</p>
						</li></ul></div>
					<p>Any IP address in those subnets will be referenced as a subdomain of those
						PTR records—for example, 10.0.1.161 will have a reverse lookup
						address of 161.1.0.10.in-addr.arpa, which is a subdomain of
						1.0.10.in-addra.arpa.</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>Specify the server to forward these lookups to.</p>
				</li><li>
					<p>Add these rules to your outbound resolver endpoint.</p>
				</li></ol></div>
			<p>Note that turning on <code class="code">enableDNSHostNames</code> for your VPC automatically adds PTR records. See <a href="./resolver.html">What is Amazon Route 53 Resolver?</a>. The previous procedure is required only if you want to explicitly specify a resolver for given IP ranges—for example, when forwarding
                queries to an Active Directory server.</p>
		 
			<h2 id="resolver-rules-managing-associating-rules">Associating forwarding rules with a VPC</h2>

			<p>After you create a forwarding rule, you must associate the rule with one or more VPCs. When you associate a rule with
				a VPC, Resolver starts to forward DNS queries for the domain name that's specified in the rule to the DNS resolvers
				that you specified in the rule. The queries pass through the outbound endpoint that you specified when you created
				the rule.</p>

			<div class="procedure"><a id="resolver-rules-managing-associating-procedure"></a><h6>To associate a forwarding rule with one or more VPCs</h6><ol><li><p>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at

					<p>Under <b>VPCs that use this rule</b>, choose the VPCs that you want to associate the rule with.</p>
				</li><li><p>Choose <b>Add</b>.</p></li></ol></div>

		 
			<h2 id="resolver-rules-managing-disassociating-rules">Disassociating forwarding rules from a VPC</h2>

			<p>You disassociate a forwarding rule from a VPC in the following circumstances:</p>
			<div class="itemizedlist">
				 
				 
			<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>For DNS queries that originate in this VPC, you want Resolver to stop forwarding queries
					for the domain name specified in the rule to your network. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You want to delete the forwarding rule. If a rule is currently associated with one or more VPCs, you must
					disassociate the rule from all VPCs before you can delete it.</p></li></ul></div>

			<p>If you want to disassociate a forwarding rule from one or more VPCs, perform the following procedure.</p>

			<div class="procedure"><a id="resolver-rules-managing-disassociating-procedure"></a><h6>To disassociate a forwarding rule from a VPC</h6><ol><li><p>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at

			<h2 id="resolver-rules-managing-sharing">Sharing forwarding rules with other AWS accounts and using shared rules</h2>

			<p>You can share the forwarding rules that you created using one AWS account with other AWS accounts. To share rules,
				the Route 53 Resolver console integrates with AWS Resource Access Manager. For more information about Resource Access Manager, see the
