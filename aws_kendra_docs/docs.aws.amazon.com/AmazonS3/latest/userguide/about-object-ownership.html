		of objects uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable <a href="./acl-overview.html">access control lists (ACLs)</a>. By default, Object Ownership is set to the Bucket
		owner enforced setting and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner
		owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to data exclusively using access
		management policies.</p><p>A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs, and we recommend
		that you keep ACLs disabled except in unusual circumstances where you must control access for each
		object individually. With ACLs disabled, you can use policies to more easily control access to every object in your bucket, regardless
		of who uploaded the objects in  your bucket. </p><p>Object Ownership has three settings that you can use to control ownership of objects
		uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
		<h6>ACLs disabled</h6>
		 
	<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
			<p><b>Bucket owner enforced (default)</b> – ACLs
				are disabled, and the bucket owner automatically owns and has full control over
				every object in the bucket. ACLs no longer affect permissions to data in the S3
				bucket. The bucket uses policies to define access control.</p>
		</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist">
		<h6>ACLs enabled</h6>
		 
		 
	<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
			<p><b>Bucket owner preferred</b> – The bucket owner
				owns and has full control over new objects that other accounts write to the bucket
				with the <code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL. </p>
		</li><li class="listitem">
			<p><b>Object writer</b> – The
				AWS account that uploads an object owns the object, has full control over it, and
				can grant other users access to it through ACLs.</p>
		</li></ul></div><p>For the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that you keep ACLs disabled by
		applying the Bucket owner enforced setting and using your bucket policy to share data with
		users outside of your account as needed. This approach simplifies permissions management.
		You can disable ACLs on both newly created and already existing buckets. For newly created
		buckets, ACLs are disabled by default. In the case of an existing bucket that already has
		objects in it, after you disable ACLs, the object and bucket ACLs are no longer part of an
		access evaluation, and access is granted or denied on the basis of policies. For existing
		buckets, you can re-enable ACLs at any time after you disable them, and your preexisting
		bucket and object ACLs are restored.</p><p>Before you disable ACLs, we recommend that you review your bucket policy to ensure that it
		covers all the ways that you intend to grant access to your bucket outside of your account. After you
		disable ACLs, your bucket accepts only PUT requests that do not specify an ACL or
			<code class="code">PUT</code> requests with bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the
			<code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL or equivalent forms of this ACL
		expressed in XML. Existing applications that support bucket owner full control ACLs see no
		impact. <code class="code">PUT</code> requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to
		certain AWS accounts) fail and return a <code class="code">400</code> error with the error code
			<code class="code">AccessControlListNotSupported</code>. </p><p>In contrast, a bucket with the Bucket owner preferred setting continues to accept and
		honor bucket and object ACLs. With this setting, new objects that are written with the
			<code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL are automatically owned by the bucket
		owner rather than the object writer. All other ACL behaviors remain in place. To require all
		Amazon S3 <code class="code">PUT</code> operations to include the <code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code>
		canned ACL, you can <a href="./ensure-object-ownership.html#ensure-object-ownership-bucket-policy">add a bucket
			policy</a> that allows only object uploads using this ACL.</p><p>To see which Object Ownership settings are applied to your buckets, you can use
		Amazon S3 Storage Lens metrics. S3 Storage Lens is a cloud-storage analytics feature that you can use to gain organization-wide
    visibility into object-storage usage and activity. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-lens-access-management.html?icmpid=docs_s3_user_guide_about-object-ownership.html"> Using S3 Storage Lens to find Object Ownership settings</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="object-ownership-changes">Changes introduced by disabling ACLs</h2>
		<p>When the Bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership is applied, ACLs are disabled and you automatically own and take full
			control over every object in the bucket without taking any additional actions. Bucket owner enforced is the default setting for all newly created buckets. 
			After the Bucket owner enforced setting is applied, you will see three changes: 
			 </p>
		<div class="itemizedlist">
			 
			 
			 
		<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
				<p>All bucket ACLs and object ACLs are disabled, which gives full access to you,
					as the bucket owner. When you perform a read ACL request on your bucket or
					object, you will see that full access is given only to the bucket owner.</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>You, as the bucket owner, automatically own and have full control over every
					object in your bucket.</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>ACLs no longer affect access permissions to your bucket. As a result, access
					control for your data is based on policies, such as IAM policies, S3 bucket

			</li></ul></div>

		</div>
		<p>If you use S3 Versioning, the bucket owner owns and has full control over all object
			versions in your bucket. Applying the Bucket owner enforced setting does not add a new
			version of an object.</p>
		<p>New objects can be uploaded to your bucket only if they use bucket owner full control
			ACLs or don't specify an ACL. Object uploads fail if they specify any other ACL. For
			more information, see <a href="./object-ownership-error-responses.html">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
		<p>Because the following example <code class="code">PutObject</code> operation using the AWS Command Line Interface
			(AWS CLI) includes the <code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL, the object can
			be uploaded to a bucket with disabled ACLs.</p>

		<p>Because the following <code class="code">PutObject</code> operation doesn't specify an ACL, it also

				additional permissions to those accounts through bucket policies. For more
				information, see <a href="./example-walkthroughs-managing-access.html">Example walkthroughs:
		Managing access to your Amazon S3 resources</a>.</p></div></div>
		 
			<h6>Re-enabling ACLs</h6>
			<p>You can re-enable ACLs by changing from the Bucket owner enforced setting to
				another Object Ownership setting at any time. If you used object ACLs for
				permissions management before you applied the Bucket owner enforced setting and you
				didn't migrate these object ACL permissions to your bucket policy, after you
				re-enable ACLs, these permissions are restored. Additionally, objects written to the
				bucket while the Bucket owner enforced setting was applied are still owned by the
				bucket owner. </p>
		 
		 
			<p>For example, if you change from the Bucket owner enforced setting back to the Object
				writer setting, you, as the bucket owner, no longer own and have full control over objects
				that were previously owned by other AWS accounts. Instead, the uploading accounts
				again own these objects. Objects owned by other accounts use ACLs for permissions,
				so you can't use policies to grant permissions to these objects. However, you, as
				the bucket owner, still own any objects that were written to the bucket while the
				Bucket owner enforced setting was applied. These objects are not owned by the object
				writer, even if you re-enable ACLs.</p>
		 
		<p>For instructions on enabling and managing ACLs using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI),
			REST API, or AWS SDKs, see <a href="./managing-acls.html">Configuring ACLs</a>.</p>
	 
		<h2 id="object-ownership-considerations">Prerequisites for disabling
				ACLs</h2>
		<p>Before you disable ACLs for an existing bucket, complete the following
			prerequisites.</p>
		 
			<h3 id="object-ownership-acl-permissions">Review bucket and object ACLs and
					migrate ACL permissions</h3>
			<p>When you disable ACLs, permissions granted by bucket and object ACLs no longer
				affect access. Before you disable ACLs, review your bucket and object ACLs. </p>
			
			<p>If your bucket ACLs grant read or write permissions to others outside of your account, you
				must migrate these permissions to your bucket policy before you can apply the Bucket
				owner enforced setting. If you don't migrate bucket ACLs that grant read or write
				access outside of your account, your request to apply the Bucket owner enforced
				setting fails and returns the <a href="./object-ownership-error-responses.html#object-ownership-error-responses-invalid-acl">InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership</a>
				error code. </p>
			<p>For example, if you want to disable ACLs for a bucket that receives server access
				logs, you must migrate the bucket ACL permissions for the S3 log delivery group to
				the logging service principal in a bucket policy. For more information, see <a href="./object-ownership-migrating-acls-prerequisites.html#object-ownership-server-access-logs">Grant access to S3 log
						delivery group for server access logging</a>.</p>
			<p>If you want the object writer to maintain full control of the object that they
				upload, object writer is the best Object Ownership setting for your use case. If
				you want to control access at the individual object level, bucket owner preferred is
				the best choice. These use cases are uncommon.</p>
			<p>To review ACLs and migrate ACL permissions to bucket policies, see <a href="./object-ownership-migrating-acls-prerequisites.html">Prerequisites for
				disabling ACLs</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="object-ownership-acl-identify">Identify requests that required an
					ACL for authorization</h3>
			<p>To identify Amazon S3 requests that required ACLs for authorization, you can use the
					<code class="code">aclRequired</code> value in Amazon S3 server access logs or AWS CloudTrail. If the
				request required an ACL for authorization or if you have <code class="code">PUT</code> requests
				that specify an ACL, the string is <code class="code">Yes</code>. If no ACLs were required, or if
				you are setting a <code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL, or if the
				requests are allowed by your bucket policy, the <code class="code">aclRequired</code> value
				string is "<code class="code">-</code>" in Amazon S3 server access logs and is absent in CloudTrail. For
				more information about the expected <code class="code">aclRequired</code> values, see <a href="./acl-overview.html#aclrequired-s3">aclRequired values for common Amazon S3
					requests</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have <code class="code">PutBucketAcl</code> or <code class="code">PutObjectAcl</code> requests with headers
				that grant ACL-based permissions, with the exception of the
					<code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL, you must remove those headers
				before you can disable ACLs. Otherwise, your requests will fail.</p>
			<p>For all other requests that required an ACL for authorization, migrate those ACL
				permissions to bucket policies. Then, remove any bucket ACLs before you enable the
				bucket owner enforced setting. </p>
			<div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>Do not remove object ACLs. Otherwise, applications that rely on object ACLs
					for permissions will lose access.</p></div></div>
			<p>If you see that no requests required an ACL for authorization, you can proceed to
				disable ACLs. For more information about identifying requests, see <a href="./using-s3-access-logs-to-identify-requests.html">Using Amazon S3 access logs to identify
        requests</a> and <a href="./cloudtrail-request-identification.html">Identifying Amazon S3 requests using CloudTrail</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="object-ownership-bucket-policies">Review and update bucket policies
					that use ACL-related condition keys</h3>
			<p>After you apply the Bucket owner enforced setting to disable ACLs, new objects can
				be uploaded to your bucket only if the request uses bucket owner full control ACLs
				or doesn't specify an ACL. Before disabling ACLs, review your bucket policy for
				ACL-related condition keys.</p>
			<p>If your bucket policy uses an ACL-related condition key to require the
					<code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL (for example,
					<code class="code">s3:x-amz-acl</code>), you don't need to update your bucket policy. The
				following bucket policy uses the <code class="code">s3:x-amz-acl</code> to require the
					<code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL for S3 <code class="code">PutObject</code>
				requests. This policy <em>still</em> requires the object
				writer to specify the <code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL. However,
				buckets with ACLs disabled still accept this ACL, so requests continue to succeed
				with no client-side changes required.</p>

		<h2 id="object-ownership-permissions">Object Ownership permissions</h2>
		<p>To apply, update, or delete an Object Ownership setting for a bucket, you need the
				<code class="code">s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls</code> permission. To return the
			Object Ownership setting for a bucket, you need the
				<code class="code">s3:GetBucketOwnershipControls</code> permission. For more information, see
				<a href="./object-ownership-new-bucket.html">Setting Object Ownership when you create
				a bucket</a> and <a href="./object-ownership-retrieving.html">Viewing the Object Ownership setting for
				an S3 bucket</a>.</p>
	 
		<h2 id="requiring-bucket-owner-enforced">Disabling ACLs for all new
				buckets</h2>
		<p>By default, all new buckets are created with the Bucket owner enforced setting applied and
			ACLs are disabled. We recommend keeping ACLs disabled. As a general rule, we recommend
			using S3 resource-based policies (bucket policies and access point policies) or IAM
			policies for access control instead of ACLs. Policies are a simplified and more flexible
			access control option. With bucket policies and access point policies, you can define
			rules that apply broadly across all requests to your Amazon S3 resources. </p>
	 
		<h2 id="object-ownership-replication">Replication and Object Ownership</h2>
		<p>When you use S3 replication and the source and destination buckets are owned by
			different AWS accounts, you can disable ACLs (with the Bucket owner enforced setting
			for Object Ownership) to change replica ownership to the AWS account that owns the
			destination bucket. This setting mimics the existing owner override behavior without the
			need of the <code class="code">s3:ObjectOwnerOverrideToBucketOwner</code> permission. All objects
			that are replicated to the destination bucket with the Bucket owner enforced setting are
			owned by the destination bucket owner. For more information about the owner override
			option for replication configurations, see <a href="./replication-change-owner.html">Changing the replica owner</a>. </p>
		
	 
		<h2 id="object-ownership-setting">Setting Object Ownership</h2>
		<p>You can apply an Object Ownership setting by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs,
			Amazon S3 REST API, or AWS CloudFormation. The following REST API and AWS CLI commands support
			Object Ownership:</p>
