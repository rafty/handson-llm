        <p>Both buckets and objects have associated ACLs that you can use to grant permissions. </p>
        <p>S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to both control ownership of the objects that are 
    uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs. By default, Object Ownership is set to the bucket owner enforced setting, 
    and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to them 
    exclusively by using access-management policies.</p>
	<p> A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs. We recommend that you keep ACLs disabled, except 
	in unusual circumstances where you need to control access for each object individually. With ACLs disabled, you can use policies 
	to control access to all objects in your bucket, regardless of who uploaded the objects to your bucket.

         Requests to read ACLs are still supported.</p></div></div>
         
            <h3 id="when-to-use-object-acl">When to use an object ACL</h3>
            <p>The following are the scenarios when you would use object ACLs to manage permissions.</p>
             
                <h6>Objects are not owned by the bucket owner</h6>
                <p>An object ACL is the only way to manage access to objects that are not owned
                    by the bucket owner. An AWS account that owns the bucket can grant another
                    AWS account permission to upload objects. The bucket owner does not own these
                    objects. The AWS account that created the object must grant permissions using
                    object ACLs.</p>
             
            <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>A bucket owner cannot grant permissions on objects it does not own. For
                    example, a bucket policy granting object permissions applies only to objects
                    owned by the bucket owner. However, the bucket owner, who pays the bills, can
                    write a bucket policy to deny access to any objects in the bucket, regardless of
                    who owns it. The bucket owner can also delete any objects in the bucket. </p></div></div>
             
                <h6>You need to manage permissions at the object level</h6>
                <p>Suppose that the permissions vary by object and you need to manage permissions
                    at the object level. You can write a single policy statement granting an
                    AWS account read permission on millions of objects with a specific <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#keyprefix">key
                        name prefix</a>. For example, you could grant read permission on objects
                    starting with the key name prefix <code class="code">logs</code>. However, if your access
                    permissions vary by object, granting permissions to individual objects using a
                    bucket policy might not be practical. Also, the bucket policies are limited to
                    20 KB in size.</p>
             
            <p>In this case, you might find using object ACLs a good alternative. However, even
                an object ACL is also limited to a maximum of 100 grants. For more information, see
                    <a href="./acl-overview.html">Access control list (ACL) overview</a>.</p>
             
                <h6>Object ACLs control only object-level permissions</h6>
                <p>
                    There is a single bucket policy for the entire bucket, but object ACLs are
                    specified per object.</p>
             
            <p>An AWS account that owns a bucket can grant another AWS account permission to
                manage an access policy. Doing so allows that account to change anything in the
                policy. To better manage permissions, you might choose not to give such a broad
                permission, and instead grant the other account only the <code class="code">READ-ACP</code> and
                    <code class="code">WRITE-ACP</code> permissions on a subset of objects. This limits the
                account to manage permissions only on specific objects by updating individual object
                ACLs.</p>
            <p>If you want to use ACLs to manage permissions at the object level and you also
                want to own new objects written to your bucket, you can apply the bucket owner
                preferred setting for Object Ownership. A bucket with the bucket owner preferred
                setting continues to accept and honor bucket and object ACLs. With this setting, new
                objects that are written with the <code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL
                will be automatically owned by the bucket owner rather than the object writer. All
                other ACL behaviors remain in place. To require all Amazon S3 PUT operations to include
                the <code class="code">bucket-owner-full-control</code> canned ACL, you can <a href="./ensure-object-ownership.html#ensure-object-ownership-bucket-policy">add a bucket policy</a> that
                allows only object uploads using this ACL.</p>
             
                <h6>Alternatives to using ACLs</h6>
                <p>In addition to an object ACL, there are other ways an object owner can manage
                    object permissions:</p>
             
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                 
                 
                 
            <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                    <p>If the AWS account that owns the object also owns the bucket, it can write
                        a bucket policy to manage the object permissions.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>If the AWS account that owns the object wants to grant permission to a
                        user in its account, it can use a user policy.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p>If you, as the bucket owner, want to automatically own and have full
                        control over every object in your bucket, you can apply the bucket owner
                        enforced setting for Object Ownership to disable ACLs. As a result, access
                        control for your data is based on policies. For more information, see <a href="./about-object-ownership.html">Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs
			for your bucket</a>.</p>
                </li></ul></div>
         
         
            <h3 id="when-to-use-bucket-acl">When to use a bucket ACL</h3>
            <p>The only recommended use case for bucket ACLs is to grant permissions to certain
                AWS services like the Amazon CloudFront <code class="code">awslogsdelivery</code> account. When you
                create or update a distribution and enable CloudFront logging, CloudFront updates the bucket ACL
                to give the <code class="code">awslogsdelivery</code> account <code class="code">FULL_CONTROL</code>
                permissions to write logs to your bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html#AccessLogsBucketAndFileOwnership">Permissions required to configure standard logging and to access your log
                    files</a> in the <em>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</em>. If the
                bucket that stores the logs uses the bucket owner enforced setting for
                S3 Object Ownership to disable ACLs, CloudFront cannot write logs to the bucket. For
                more information, see <a href="./about-object-ownership.html">Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs
			for your bucket</a>.</p>
         
     
        <h2 id="when-to-use-bucket-policy">When to use a bucket policy</h2>
        <p>If an AWS account that owns a bucket wants to grant permission to users in its
            account, it can use either a bucket policy or a user policy. However, in the following
            scenarios, you must use a bucket policy.</p>
         
            <h6>You want to manage cross-account permissions for all Amazon S3 permissions</h6>
            <p>You can use ACLs to grant cross-account permissions to other accounts. But ACLs
                support only a finite set of permissions, and these don't include all Amazon S3
                permissions. For more information, see <a href="./acl-overview.html#permissions">What permissions can I grant?</a> For example, you can't grant permissions on bucket
                subresources. For more information, see <a href="./s3-access-control.html">Identity and access management in Amazon S3</a>.</p>
         
        <p>Both bucket and user policies support granting permission for all Amazon S3
            operations. (For more information, see <a href="./using-with-s3-actions.html">Amazon S3 actions</a>.) However, the user policies are for
            managing permissions for users in your account. For cross-account permissions to other
            AWS accounts or users in another account, you must use a bucket policy.</p>
        
     
        <h2 id="when-to-use-user-policy">When to use a user policy</h2>
        <p>In general, you can use either a user policy or a bucket policy to manage permissions.
            You can choose to manage permissions by creating users and managing permissions
            individually by attaching policies to users (or user groups). Or, you might find that
            resource-based policies, such as a bucket policy, work better for your scenario.</p>
        <p>With AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) you can create multiple users within your AWS account and
            manage their permissions through user policies. An IAM user must have permissions from
            the parent account to which it belongs, and from the AWS account that owns the
            resource that the user wants to access. The permissions can be granted as
            follows:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
        <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="topcom">Permission from the parent account</span> – The
                    parent account can grant permissions to its user by attaching a user
                    policy.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p><span class="topcom">Permission from the resource owner</span> – The
                    resource owner can grant permission to either the IAM user (by using a bucket
                    policy) or the parent account (by using a bucket policy, bucket ACL, or object
                    ACL).</p>

        <p>This is similar to a child who wants to play with a toy that belongs to someone else.
            To play with the toy, the child must get permission from a parent  and permission from
            the toy owner.</p>

            <h3 id="permission-delegation">Permission delegation</h3>
            <p>If an AWS account owns a resource, it can grant those permissions to another AWS account. That account can then delegate those permissions, or a subset of them, to
                users in the account. This is referred to as permission delegation. But an account
                that receives permissions from another account cannot delegate permission
                cross-account to another AWS account. </p>
