		<h2 id="S3OutpostsConcepts">How S3 on Outposts works</h2>
		<p>S3 on Outposts is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets
			on your Outpost. An <em>object</em> is a data file and any
			metadata that describes the file. A <em>bucket</em> is a
			container for objects. </p>
		<p>To store your data in S3 on Outposts, you first create a bucket. When you create the
			bucket, you specify a bucket name and the Outpost that will hold the bucket. To access
			your S3 on Outposts bucket and perform object operations, you next create and configure an
			access point. You must also create an endpoint to route requests to your access point. </p>
		<p>Access points simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that
			stores data in S3. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets
			and can be used to perform object operations, such as <code class="code">GetObject</code> and
				<code class="code">PutObject</code>. Each access point has distinct permissions and network
			controls. </p>
		<p>You can create and manage your S3 on Outposts buckets, access points, and endpoints by
			using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API. To upload and manage objects in
			your S3 on Outposts bucket, you can use the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API. </p>
		 
			<h3 id="aws-region-s3-outposts">Regions</h3>
			<p>During AWS Outposts provisioning, you or AWS creates a service link connection that
				connects your Outpost back to your chosen AWS Region or Outposts home Region for
				bucket operations and telemetry. An Outpost relies on connectivity to the parent
				AWS Region. The Outposts rack is not designed for disconnected operations or
				environments with limited to no connectivity. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/how-outposts-works.html#region-connectivity">Outpost connectivity to AWS Regions</a> in the <em>AWS Outposts User Guide</em>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsBucketS3Outposts">Buckets</h3>
			<p>A bucket is a container for objects stored in S3 on Outposts. You can store any
				number of objects in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets per account per
				Outpost. </p>
			<p>When you create a bucket, you enter a bucket name and choose the Outpost where the
				bucket will reside. After you create a bucket, you cannot change the bucket name or
				move the bucket to a different Outpost. Bucket names must follow <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html">Amazon S3
					bucket naming rules</a>. In S3 on Outposts, bucket names are unique to an
				Outpost and AWS account. S3 on Outposts buckets require the <code class="code">outpost-id</code>,
					<code class="code">account-id</code>, and bucket name to identify them. </p>
			<p>The following example shows the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for S3 on Outposts
				buckets. The ARN is comprised of the Region your Outpost is homed to, your Outpost
				account, the Outpost ID, and the bucket name.</p>
			<pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">arn:aws:s3-outposts:<code class="replaceable">region</code>:<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:outpost/<code class="replaceable">outpost-id</code>/bucket/<code class="replaceable">bucket-name</code></code></pre>
			<p>Every object is contained in a bucket. You must use access points to access any object in
				an Outposts bucket. When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the
				access point ARN or access point alias. For more information about access point aliases, see <a href="./s3-outposts-access-points-alias.html">Using a bucket-style alias for your
            S3 on Outposts bucket access point</a>. </p>
			<p>The following example shows the access point ARN format for S3 on Outposts, which
				includes the <code class="code">outpost-id</code>, <code class="code">account-id</code>, and access point
				name:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">arn:aws:s3-outposts:<code class="replaceable">region</code>:<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:outpost/<code class="replaceable">outpost-id</code>/accesspoint/<code class="replaceable">accesspoint-name</code></code></pre>
			<p>For more information about buckets, see <a href="./S3OutpostsWorkingBuckets.html">Working with S3 on Outposts buckets</a>. </p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsObjectsS3Outposts">Objects</h3>
			<p>Objects are the fundamental entities stored in S3 on Outposts. Objects consist of
				object data and metadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe
				the object. These pairs include some default metadata, such as the date last
				modified, and standard HTTP metadata, such as <code class="code">Content-Type</code>. You can
				also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored. An object is
				uniquely identified within a bucket by a <a href="./Welcome.html#BasicsKeys">key (or
					name)</a>.</p>
			
        <p>With Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost. When AWS installs an Outpost rack, your data stays local to 
        your Outpost to meet data-residency requirements. Your objects never leave your
				Outpost and are not in an AWS Region. Because the AWS Management Console is hosted in-Region, you can't use the console to upload or manage objects in
				your Outpost. However, you can use the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs to upload and manage your objects through your access points.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsKeysS3Outposts">Keys</h3>
			<p>An <em>object key</em> (or <em>key
					name</em>) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every
				object in a bucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket and object key
				uniquely identifies each object. </p>
			<p>The following example shows the ARN format for S3 on Outposts objects, which
				includes the AWS Region code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to,
				AWS account ID, Outpost ID, bucket name, and object key:</p>
			<pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">arn:aws:s3-outposts:<code class="replaceable">us-west-2</code>:<code class="replaceable">123456789012</code>:​outpost/<code class="replaceable">op-01ac5d28a6a232904</code>/bucket/<code class="replaceable"><code class="replaceable">DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET1</code>/object/myobject</code></code></pre>
			<p>For more information about object keys, see <a href="./S3OutpostsWorkingObjects.html">Working with S3 on Outposts objects</a>.
			</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="S3OutpostsVersioning">S3 Versioning</h3>
			<p>You can use S3 Versioning on Outposts buckets to keep multiple variants of an
				object in the same bucket. With S3 Versioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and
				restore every version of every object stored in your buckets. S3 Versioning helps you
				recover from unintended user actions and application failures. </p>
			<p>For more information, see <a href="./S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.html">Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts
            bucket</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="S3OutpostsVersionID">Version ID</h3>
			<p>When you enable S3 Versioning in a bucket, S3 on Outposts generates a unique version
				ID for each object added to the bucket. Objects that already existed in the bucket
				at the time that you enable versioning have a version ID of <code class="code">null</code>. If
				you modify these (or any other) objects with other operations, such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html">PutObject</a>, the new objects get a unique version ID.</p>
			<p>For more information, see <a href="./S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.html">Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts
            bucket</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="S3OutpostsStorageClasses">Storage class and encryption</h3>
			<p>S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts (<code class="code">OUTPOSTS</code>).
				The S3 Outposts storage class is available only for objects stored in buckets on
				AWS Outposts. If you try to use other S3 storage classes with S3 on Outposts, S3 on Outposts
				returns the <code class="code">InvalidStorageClass</code> error. </p>
			<p>By default, objects stored in the S3 Outposts (<code class="code">OUTPOSTS</code>) storage
				class are encrypted using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys
				(SSE-S3). For more information, see <a href="./s3-outposts-data-encryption.html">Data encryption in S3 on Outposts</a>. </p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="S3OutpostsBucketPolicies">Bucket policy</h3>
			<p>A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you can use to
				grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner
				can associate a policy with a bucket. The permissions attached to the bucket apply
				to all of the objects in the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner. Bucket
				policies are limited to 20 KB in size.</p>
			<p>Bucket policies use JSON-based IAM policy language that is standard across
				AWS. You can use bucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a
				bucket. Bucket policies allow or deny requests based on the elements in the policy.
				These elements can include the requester, S3 on Outposts actions, resources, and
				aspects or conditions of the request (for example, the IP address used to make the
				request). For example, you can create a bucket policy that grants cross-account
				permissions to upload objects to an S3 on Outposts bucket while ensuring that the
				bucket owner has full control of the uploaded objects. For more information, see
					<a href="./example-bucket-policies.html">Bucket policy examples</a>.</p>
			<p>In your bucket policy, you can use wildcard characters (<code class="code">*</code>) in ARNs
				and other values to grant permissions to a subset of objects. For example, you can
				control access to groups of objects that begin with a common <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#keyprefix">prefix</a> or end with a given extension, such as
				<code class="code">.html</code>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsAccessPointsS3Outposts">S3 on Outposts access points</h3>
			<p>S3 on Outposts access points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that
				describe how data can be accessed using that endpoint. Access points simplify managing
				data access at scale for shared datasets in S3 on Outposts. Access points are attached to
				buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as
					<code class="code">GetObject</code> and <code class="code">PutObject</code>. </p>
			<p>When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the access point ARN or access point alias.
				For more information about access point aliases, see <a href="./s3-outposts-access-points-alias.html">Using a bucket-style alias for your
            S3 on Outposts bucket access point</a>.</p>
			<p>Access points have distinct permissions and network controls that S3 on Outposts
				applies for any request that is made through that access point. Each access point enforces a
				customized access point policy that works in conjunction with the bucket policy that is
				attached to the underlying bucket.</p>

                objects</a>.</p>
