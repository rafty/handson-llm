    Every node connected to an Internet Protocol (IP) network must have
    an IP address for communication purposes. As the internet continues
    to grow, so does the need for IP addresses. IPv6 is a version of the
    Internet Protocol that uses a larger address space than its
    predecessor, IPv4. This whitepaper focuses on best practices for
    adopting and designing IPv6-based networks on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
    Cloud. It covers IPv6-only and dual-stack networks
    for both internet-facing and private IPv6 networks use cases.

The six pillars of the Framework allow you to learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems.

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    
    
    <p>
      An increasing number of organizations operate dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
      networks. Carrier networks and ISPs were the first groups to start
      deploying IPv6 on their networks, with mobile networks leading the
      charge. Adoption of IPv6 has been delayed, partly due to network
      address translation (NAT) with IPv4, which takes private IP
      addresses and turns them into public IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      An increasing number of organizations are adopting IPv6 in their
      environments, driven by the public IPv4 space exhaustion, private
      IPv4 scarcity, especially within large-scale networks, and the need
      to provide connectivity to IPv6-only clients. There is no
      one-size-fits-all approach with IPv6; however, there are best
      practices AWS customers can follow to plan and implement IPv6 into
      their existing cloud networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This whitepaper explains key drivers for adoption and highlights
      best practices to guide you while leaving enough space for you to
      decide, based on your specific use case and implementation, how to
      approach IPv6 in your network.

      <p>
        Adhering to the following tenets for IPv6 adoption can help make
        the process and decision more manageable:

          <p>
            <b>Re-evaluate network
              controls</b> — IPv6 offers opportunities to rethink
            your approach to perimeter security and make design decisions
            that further improve your security posture.
          </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>
            <b>Design for scale</b> — More
            usable IPv6 addresses doesn’t mean you can shortcut IP
            allocation and planning.

        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>
            <b>Phase your IPv6 adoption</b> — Focus on your business needs
            to implement IPv6 where needed, and remember that IPv4 and IPv6 can be made to coexist
            as long as needed. </p>

      <h3 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h3>
      
      
      <p>
        Considering the variety of drivers, both internal and external,
        IPv6 adoption affects organizations regardless of size, industry
        sector, or geography. The best practices and design considerations
        outlined in this paper are oriented toward cloud architects and
        network technical leads who are responsible for the overall
        network design and architecture of their AWS environment. Whether
        you are new to AWS or you have already been using AWS for years,
        your team will benefit from reviewing this paper and deciding what
        is applicable based on your requirements and your current AWS
        environment.
