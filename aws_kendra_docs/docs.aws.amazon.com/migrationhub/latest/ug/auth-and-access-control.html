        Those credentials must have permissions to access AWS resources, such as an Migration Hub
        ProgressUpdateStream or an Amazon EC2 instance. The following sections provide details on how you
        can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> and Migration Hub to
        help secure your resources by controlling who can access them:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">

            <p><a href="#access-control">Access control</a></p>
        </li></ul></div>
 <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
 <p>You can access AWS as any of the following types of identities:</p>
 <div class="itemizedlist">
  
  
  
 <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
 <p><b>AWS account root user</b></p>
 <p>

 When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services
 and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account <em>root user</em> and is accessed by
 signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We 
 strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to
 perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">Tasks that require root user credentials</a> in the <em>AWS Account Management Reference Guide</em>.
 </p>
 </li><li class="listitem">
 <p><b>IAM users and groups</b> 
   
         </p><p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. However, if you have specific use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate access keys. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials">Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-term credentials</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p><p>An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html"><em>IAM group</em></a> is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users.
            You can't sign in as a group. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for
            large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named <em>IAMAdmins</em> and give that group permissions to administer IAM
            resources.</p><p>Users are different from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone
            who needs it. Users have permanent long-term credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_which-to-choose">When to create an IAM user (instead of a role)</a> in the
               <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
 
 </li><li class="listitem">
 <p><b>IAM role</b></p>
 <p>
 
    An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> is an IAM identity that 
    you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to 
    an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine 
    what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated 
    with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role 
    does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated 
    with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials 
    for your role session.
  IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the
 following situations:</p>
 <div class="itemizedlist">
  
  
  
 <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
 <p><b>Federated user access</b> – 

To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role and define permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by the role. For information about roles for federation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html">
Creating a role for a third-party Identity Provider</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

<span>If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set. To control what your identities can access after they authenticate, IAM Identity Center correlates the permission set to a role in IAM. 
For information about permissions sets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.html">
Permission sets</a> in the <em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em>.</span>
</p>
 </li><li class="listitem">
 <p><b>AWS service access</b> – 

      A service role is an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> that a service assumes to perform 
      actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For 
      more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html">Creating a role to delegate permissions 
      to an AWS service</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
  </p>
 </li><li class="listitem">
 <p><b>Applications running on Amazon EC2</b> – 

      You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. 
      This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it 
      available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the 
      instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to
      get temporary credentials. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances</a> in the 
      <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

        <h2 id="access-control">Access control</h2>

        <p>You can have valid credentials to authenticate your requests, but unless you have
            permissions you cannot create or access AWS Migration Hub resources. For example, you must
            have permissions to create a Migration Hub API type, <code class="code">ProgressUpdateStream</code>, to use
            the AWS Application Discovery Service, and to use AWS migration tools.</p>
