      <p>How you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) differs, depending on the work you do in <span>Amazon Aurora</span>.</p>
      <p><b>Service user</b> – If you use the <span>Aurora</span> service to do your job, then your administrator provides you
         with the credentials and permissions that you need. As you use more <span>Aurora</span> features to do your work, you might need additional permissions.
         Understanding how access is managed can help you request the right permissions from your administrator. If you cannot access a feature in
         <span>Aurora</span>, see <a href="./security_iam_troubleshoot.html">Troubleshooting Amazon Aurora identity and access</a>.</p>
      
      <p><b>Service administrator</b> – If you're in charge of <span>Aurora</span> resources at your company, you probably have
         full access to <span>Aurora</span>. It's your job to determine which <span>Aurora</span> features and resources your employees should access. You must then
         submit requests to your administrator to change the permissions of your service users. Review the information on this page to understand the
         basic concepts of IAM. To learn more about how your company can use IAM with <span>Aurora</span>, see <a href="./security_iam_service-with-iam.html">How Amazon Aurora works with IAM</a>.</p>
      
      <p><b>Administrator</b> – If you're an administrator, you might want to learn details about how you can
         write policies to manage access to <span>Aurora</span>. To view example <span>Aurora</span> identity-based policies that you can use in IAM, see <a href="./security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html">Identity-based policy
            examples for Amazon Aurora</a>.</p>
    
      <h2 id="security_iam_authentication">Authenticating with identities</h2>
      
   
<p>Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. You must be
<em>authenticated</em> (signed in to AWS) as the AWS account root user, as an
IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role.</p>

<p>You can sign in to AWS as a federated identity by using credentials provided through an identity source.
AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center) users, your company's single sign-on authentication, and your Google or Facebook
credentials are examples of federated identities. When you sign in as a federated identity, your administrator previously set up identity federation using IAM roles. When you access AWS by using federation, you are indirectly assuming a role.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the AWS access
portal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html">How to sign in to your AWS account</a>
in the <em>AWS Sign-In User Guide</em>.</p>

<p>If you access AWS programmatically, AWS provides a software development kit (SDK) and a
command line interface (CLI) to cryptographically sign your requests using your credentials. If
you don't use AWS tools, you must sign requests yourself. For more information about using the recommended method
to sign requests yourself, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 signing process</a> in
the <em>AWS General Reference</em>.</p>

<p>Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might be required to provide
additional security information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor
authentication (MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html">Multi-factor authentication</a> in the
<em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>


  
       
         <h3 id="security_iam_authentication-rootuser">AWS account root user</h3>
         
         
         <p>

 When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services
 and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account <em>root user</em> and is accessed by
 signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We 
 strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to
 perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">Tasks that require root user credentials</a> in the <em>AWS Account Management Reference Guide</em>.
 </p>
         
       
       
         <h3 id="security_iam_authentication-federatedidentity">Federated identity</h3>
         
         
         

<p>As a best practice, require human users, including users that require administrator access, to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS services by using temporary credentials.</p>

<p>A <em>federated identity</em> is a user from your enterprise user directory, a web identity provider, the AWS Directory Service, <span>the Identity Center directory, </span>or any user that
accesses AWS services by using credentials provided through an identity source. When federated identities access AWS accounts, they assume roles, and the roles provide temporary credentials.</p>

<p>For centralized access management, we recommend that you use AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On). You can create users and groups in IAM Identity Center, or you can connect and synchronize 
to a set of users and groups in your own identity source for use across all your AWS accounts and applications. For information 
about IAM Identity Center, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em>.</p>

         
       
       
         <h3 id="security_iam_authentication-iamuser">IAM users and groups</h3>
         
   
         <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. However, if you have specific use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate access keys. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials">Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-term credentials</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         
         <p>An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html"><em>IAM group</em></a> is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users.
            You can't sign in as a group. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for
            large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named <em>IAMAdmins</em> and give that group permissions to administer IAM
            resources.</p>
         <p>Users are different from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone
            who needs it. Users have permanent long-term credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_which-to-choose">When to create an IAM user (instead of a role)</a> in the
               <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
           
         
         <p>You can authenticate to your DB <span>cluster</span> using IAM database authentication.</p>
         
         
         
         
          
         <p><span>IAM database authentication works with Aurora. </span>For more information 
            about authenticating to your DB <span>cluster</span> 
            using IAM, see <a href="./UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html">IAM database authentication</a>.</p>        
       
       
         <h3 id="security_iam_authentication-iamrole">IAM roles</h3>
         
         
         <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that
            has specific permissions. It is similar to a user, but is not associated with a specific person. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in
            the AWS Management Console by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html">switching roles</a>. You can assume a role by calling an AWS CLI
            or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information about methods for using roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM roles</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         <p>IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:</p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
             
             
             
         <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
               <p><b>Temporary user permissions</b> – A user can assume an IAM role to temporarily take on
                  different permissions for a specific task. </p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p><b>Federated user access</b> – 

To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role and define permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by the role. For information about roles for federation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html">
Creating a role for a third-party Identity Provider</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

<span>If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set. To control what your identities can access after they authenticate, IAM Identity Center correlates the permission set to a role in IAM. 
For information about permissions sets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.html">

</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p><b>Cross-account access</b> – You can use an
                  IAM role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a different account to access
                  resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account
                  access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a
                  resource (instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the difference between
                  roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How IAM roles
                     differ from resource-based policies</a> in the

            </li><li class="listitem">
               <p><b>Cross-service access</b> –

      Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, 
      it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this 
      using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role.

                     <p><b>Principal permissions</b> –

      When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies 
      grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers 
      another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To 
      see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrds.html.html">Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon RDS</a> in the

      A service role is an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> that a service assumes to perform 
      actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For

               <p><b>Applications running on Amazon EC2</b> –

      You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. 
      This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it 
      available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the 
      instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to
      get temporary credentials. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances</a> in the 
      <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

               user)</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         
       
    
      <h2 id="security_iam_access-manage">Managing access using policies</h2>
      
      
      <p>You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that,
         when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an entity (root user, user, or IAM
         role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON
         documents. For more information about the structure and contents of JSON policy documents, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json">Overview of JSON policies</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
      <p>An administrator can use policies to specify who has access to AWS resources, and what actions they can perform on those resources. Every
         IAM entity (permission set or role) starts with no permissions. In other words, by default, users can do nothing, not even change their own password. To give a
         user permission to do something, an administrator must attach a permissions policy to a user. Or the administrator can add the user to a group that has
         the intended permissions. When an administrator gives permissions to a group, all users in that group are granted those permissions.</p>
      <p>IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, suppose that you have a
         policy that allows the <code class="code">iam:GetRole</code> action. A user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS
         API.</p>
      
       
         <h3 id="security_iam_access-manage-id-based-policies">Identity-based policies</h3>
         
         
         <p>Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as a permission set or role. These
            policies control what actions that identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based
            policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html">Creating IAM policies</a> in the
            <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         <p>Identity-based policies can be further categorized as <em>inline policies</em> or <em>managed
               policies</em>. Inline policies are embedded directly into a single permission set or role. Managed policies are standalone policies that you
            can attach to multiple permission sets and roles in your AWS account. Managed policies include AWS managed policies and customer managed
            policies. To learn how to choose between a managed policy or an inline policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#choosing-managed-or-inline">Choosing between managed policies and inline
               policies</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>

         <p>AWS supports additional, less-common policy types. These policy types can set the maximum permissions granted to you by the more common policy
            types. </p>

               <p><b>Permissions boundaries</b> – A permissions
                  boundary is an advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions that an
                  identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity (permission set or role). You can
                  set a permissions boundary for an entity. The resulting permissions are the
                  intersection of entity's identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.
                  Resource-based policies that specify the permission set or role in the
                     <code class="code">Principal</code> field are not limited by the permissions boundary. An
                  explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information

               <p><b>Service control policies (SCPs)</b> – SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for
                  an organization or organizational unit (OU) in AWS Organizations. AWS Organizations is a service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts
                  that your business owns. If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to any or all of
                  your accounts. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. For more information about Organizations and

                  permissions are the intersection of the permission sets or role's identity-based policies and
                  the session policies. Permissions can also come from a resource-based policy. An
                  explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information,
