    <h2 id="security-notifications">Understanding notification contents and
        security</h2>
    <p>Notifications provide information about resources to users who are subscribed to the
      notification rule targets that you configure. This information can include details about your
      developer tool resources, including repository contents, build statuses, deployment statuses,
      and pipeline executions. </p>
    <p>For example, you can configure a notification rule for a repository in CodeCommit to include
      comments on commits or pull requests. If so, the notifications sent in response to that rule
      might contain the line or lines of code referenced in that comment. Similarly, you can
      configure a notification rule for a build project in CodeBuild to include successes or failures
      for build states and phases. Notifications sent in response to that rule will contain that
      information. </p>
    <p>You can configure a notification rule for a pipeline in CodePipeline to include information about
      manual approvals, and notifications sent in response to that rule might contain the name of
      the person providing that approval. You can configure a notification rule for an application
      in CodeDeploy to indicate deployment success, and notifications sent in response to that rule might
      contain information about the deployment target.</p>
    <p>Notifications can include project-specific information such as build statuses, lines of
      code that have comments, deployment states, and pipeline approvals. So to help ensure the
      security of your project, make sure that you regularly review both the targets of notification
      rules and the list of subscribers of the Amazon SNS topics specified as targets. Additionally, the
      content of notifications sent in response to events might change as additional features are
      added to the underlying services. This change can happen without notice to already-existing
      notification rules. Consider reviewing the contents of notification messages periodically to
      help ensure that you understand what is being sent, as well as to whom it is being
      sent.</p>
    <p>For more information about the event types available for notification rules, see <a href="./concepts.html">Notification concepts</a>.</p>
    <p>You can choose to limit the details included in notifications to only what is included in
      an event. This is referred to as the <b>Basic</b> detail type. These events
      contain exactly the same information as is sent to Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch Events. </p>
    <p>Developer Tools console services, such as CodeCommit, might choose to add information about some or all of
      their event types in notification messages beyond what is available in an event. This
      supplemental information could be added at any time to enhance current event types or
      supplement future event types. You can choose to include any supplemental information about
      the event, if available, in the notification by choosing the <b>Full</b> detail
      type. For more information, see <a href="./concepts.html#detail-type">Detail types</a>.</p>
