			Standard Reserved Instances, which vary in term lengths and pricing options. For example, you might
			want to sell Reserved Instances after moving instances to a new AWS Region, changing to a new
			instance type, ending projects before the term expiration, when your business needs
			change, or if you have unneeded capacity.</p><p>As soon as you list your Reserved Instances in the Reserved Instance Marketplace, they are available
				for potential buyers to find. All Reserved Instances are grouped according to the
				duration of the term remaining and the hourly price.</p><p>To fulfill a buyer's request, AWS first sells the Reserved Instance with the
				lowest upfront price in the specified grouping. Then, AWS sells the Reserved Instance
				with the next lowest price, until the buyer's entire order is fulfilled. AWS then
				processes the transactions and transfers ownership of the Reserved Instances to the
				buyer. </p><p>You own your Reserved Instance until it's sold. After the sale, you've given up the
				capacity reservation and the discounted recurring fees. If you continue to use your
				instance, AWS charges you the On-Demand price starting from the time that your
				Reserved Instance was sold.</p><p>If you want to sell your unused Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace, you must meet
				certain eligibility criteria.</p><p>For information about buying Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace, see <a href="./ri-market-concepts-buying.html#ri-market-buying-guide">Buy from the Reserved Instance Marketplace</a>.</p><div class="highlights" id="inline-topiclist"><h6>Contents</h6><ul><li><a href="#ri-seller-limits">Restrictions and limitations</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-seller-profile">Register as a seller</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-concepts-bank">Bank account for disbursement</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-concepts-taxinfo">Tax information</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-concepts-pricing">Price your Reserved Instances</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-selling-listing">List your Reserved Instances</a></li><li><a href="#ri-listing-states">Reserved Instance listing states</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-concepts-sold-partial">Lifecycle of a listing</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-concepts-sold">After your Reserved Instance is sold</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-sold-gettingpaid">Getting paid</a></li><li><a href="#ri-market-seller-disclosure">Information shared with the buyer</a></li></ul></div>

				<h2 id="ri-market-concepts-taxinfo">Tax information</h2>
				<p>Your sale of Reserved Instances might be subject to a transaction-based tax, such as sales tax or
					value-added tax. You should check with your business's tax, legal, finance,
					or accounting department to determine if transaction-based taxes are
					applicable. You are responsible for collecting and sending the
					transaction-based taxes to the appropriate tax authority.</p>
				<p>As part of the seller registration process, you must complete a tax interview in the
					<a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ri/seller_registration?action=taxInterview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Seller Registration Portal</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. The interview collects your tax
					information and populates an IRS form W-9, W-8BEN, or W-8BEN-E, which is
					used to determine any necessary tax reporting obligations. </p>
				<p>The tax information you enter as part of the tax interview might differ
					depending on whether you operate as an individual or business, and whether
					you or your business are a US or non-US person or entity. As you fill out
					the tax interview, keep in mind the following:</p>
				<div class="itemizedlist">
					 
					 
					 
				<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						<p>Information provided by AWS, including the information in this
							topic, does not constitute tax, legal, or other professional advice.
							To find out how the IRS reporting requirements might affect your
							business, or if you have other questions, contact your tax, legal,
							or other professional advisor.</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>To fulfill the IRS reporting requirements as efficiently as
							possible, answer all questions and enter all information requested
							during the interview.</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>Check your answers. Avoid misspellings or entering incorrect tax
							identification numbers. They can result in an invalidated tax form.
						</p>
					</li></ul></div>
				<p>Based on your tax interview responses and IRS reporting thresholds, Amazon might file Form
					1099-K. Amazon mails a copy of your Form 1099-K on or before January 31 in the
					year following the year that your tax account reaches the threshold levels. For
					example, if your account reaches the threshold in 2018, your Form 1099-K is
					mailed on or before January 31, 2019.</p>
				<p>For more information about IRS requirements and Form 1099-K, see the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/form-1099-k-frequently-asked-questions-reporting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>IRS</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> website.</p>
			 
			<h2 id="ri-market-concepts-pricing">Price your Reserved Instances</h2>
			<p>When setting the price for your Reserved Instances, consider the following:</p>
			<div class="itemizedlist">
				 
				 
				 
				 
			<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
					<p><b>Upfront price</b> – The upfront price is the only
						price that you can specify for the Reserved Instance that you're selling. The upfront
						price is the one-time price that the buyer pays when they purchase a
						Reserved Instance.</p>
					<p>Because the value of Reserved Instances decreases over time, by default, AWS can set
						prices to decrease in equal increments month over month. However, you can
						set different upfront prices based on when your reservation sells. For
						example, if your Reserved Instance has nine months of its term remaining, you can specify
						the amount that you would accept if a customer were to purchase that Reserved Instance
						with nine months remaining. You could set another price with five months
						remaining, and yet another price with one month remaining.</p>
					<p>The minimum allowed price in the Reserved Instance Marketplace is $0.00.</p>
				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p><b>Limits</b> – The following limits for selling Reserved Instances
						apply to the <em>lifetime</em> of your
						AWS account. They are not annual limits.</p>
					<div class="itemizedlist">
						 
						 
					<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							<p><span class="topcom">You can sell up to $50,000 in Reserved Instances</span>.</p>
						</li><li class="listitem">
							<p><span class="topcom">You can sell up to 5,000 Reserved Instances</span>.</p>

				<h2 id="ri-market-selling-listing">List your Reserved Instances</h2>
				<p>As a registered seller, you can choose to sell one or more of your Reserved Instances. You
                    can choose to sell all of them in one listing or in portions. In addition, you
                    can list Reserved Instances with any configuration of instance type, platform,
                    and scope.</p>
				<p>The console determines a suggested price. It checks for offerings that match 
					your Reserved Instance and matches the one with the lowest price. Otherwise, it calculates a 
					suggested price based on the cost of the Reserved Instance for its remaining time. If the 
					calculated value is less than $1.01, the suggested price is $1.01.</p>
				<p>If you cancel your listing and a portion of that listing has already been
					sold, the cancellation is not effective on the portion that has been sold. Only
					the unsold portion of the listing is no longer available in the
					Reserved Instance Marketplace.</p>

				<h2 id="ri-listing-states">Reserved Instance listing states</h2>
				<p><b>Listing State</b> on the <b>My Listings</b>
					tab of the Reserved Instances page displays the current status of your
					listings:</p>
				<p>The information displayed by <b>Listing State</b> is about
					the status of your listing in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. It is different from the
					status information that is displayed by the <b>State</b>
					column in the <b>Reserved Instances</b> page. This
					<b>State</b> information is about your reservation.</p>
				<div class="itemizedlist">
					 
					 
					 
				<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						<p><b>active</b>—The listing is available for
							purchase.</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p><b>canceled</b>—The listing is canceled and
							isn't available for purchase in the Reserved Instance Marketplace.</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p><b>closed</b>—The Reserved Instance is not
							listed. A Reserved Instance might be <code class="code">closed</code> because the

					</li></ul></div>
			 
				<h2 id="ri-market-concepts-sold-partial">Lifecycle of a listing</h2>
				<p>When all the instances in your listing are matched and sold, the <b>My
						Listings</b> tab shows that the <b>Total instance
						count</b> matches the count listed under <b>Sold</b>.
					Also, there are no <b>Available</b> instances left for your
					listing, and its <b>Status</b> is <code class="code">closed</code>.</p>
				<p>When only a portion of your listing is sold, AWS retires the Reserved Instances in the listing and creates the number of Reserved Instances equal to
					the Reserved Instances remaining in the count. So, the listing ID and the
					listing that it represents, which now has fewer reservations for sale, is still
					active.</p>
				<p>Any future sales of Reserved Instances in this listing are processed this way.
					When all the Reserved Instances in the listing are sold, AWS marks the listing
					as <code class="code">closed</code>.</p>
				<p>For example, you create a listing <em>Reserved Instances listing ID
						5ec28771-05ff-4b9b-aa31-9e57dexample</em> with a listing count of
					5.</p>
				<p>The <b>My Listings</b> tab in the <b>Reserved
						Instance</b> console page displays the listing this way:</p>
				<p><em>Reserved Instance listing ID
						5ec28771-05ff-4b9b-aa31-9e57dexample</em></p>
				<div class="itemizedlist">
					 
					 
					 
					 
				<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						<p>Total reservation count = 5</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>Sold = 0</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>Available = 5</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>Status = active</p>
					</li></ul></div>
				<p> A buyer purchases two of the reservations, which leaves a count of three
					reservations still available for sale. Because of this partial sale, AWS
					creates a new reservation with a count of three to represent the remaining
					reservations that are still for sale.</p>
				<p>This is how your listing looks in the <b>My Listings</b>
					tab:</p>
				<p><em>Reserved Instance listing ID
						5ec28771-05ff-4b9b-aa31-9e57dexample</em></p>
				<div class="itemizedlist">
					 
					 
					 
					 
				<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						<p>Total reservation count = 5</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>Sold = 2</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>Available = 3</p>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<p>Status = active</p>
					</li></ul></div>
				<p>If you cancel your listing and a portion of that listing has already sold, the
					cancelation is not effective on the portion that has been sold. Only the unsold
					portion of the listing is no longer available in the Reserved Instance Marketplace.</p>
			 
				<h2 id="ri-market-concepts-sold">After your Reserved Instance is sold</h2>
				<p>When your Reserved Instance is sold, AWS sends you an email notification. Each day that there is any
					kind of activity, you receive one email notification capturing all the
					activities of the day. Activities can include when you create or sell a listing,
					or when AWS sends funds to your account.</p>
				
				<div class="procedure"><h6>To track the status of a Reserved Instance listing in the console</h6><ol><li>
						<p>Open the Amazon EC2 console at
         <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
					</li><li>
						<p>In the navigation page, choose <b>Reserved
							Instances</b>.</p>
					</li><li>
						<p>Choose the <b>My Listings</b> tab.</p>
						<p>The <b>My Listings</b> tab contains the
								<b>Listing State</b> value. It also contains
							information about the term, listing price, and a breakdown of how many
							instances in the listing are available, pending, sold, and
							canceled.</p>
					</li></ol></div>
				<p>You can also use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-reserved-instances-listings.html">describe-reserved-instances-listings</a> command with the
					appropriate filter to obtain information about your listings.</p>
			 
				<h2 id="ri-market-sold-gettingpaid">Getting paid</h2>
				<p>As soon as AWS receives funds from the buyer, a message is sent to the
					registered owner account email for the sold Reserved Instance.</p>
				<p>AWS sends an Automated Clearing House (ACH) wire transfer to your
					specified bank account. Typically, this transfer occurs between one to three
					days after your Reserved Instance has been sold. Disbursements take place once a day.
					You will receive an email with a disbursement report after the funds are 
					released. Keep in mind that you can't receive disbursements until AWS 
					receives verification from your bank. This can take up to two weeks.</p>
				<p>The Reserved Instance that you sold continues to appear when you describe
					your Reserved Instances.</p>
				<p>You receive a cash disbursement for your Reserved Instances through a wire
					transfer directly into your bank account. AWS charges a service fee of 12
					percent of the total upfront price of each Reserved Instance you sell in the
					Reserved Instance Marketplace.</p>
			 
				<h2 id="ri-market-seller-disclosure">Information shared with the buyer</h2>

				<p>When you sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace, AWS shares your company’s legal name on
					the buyer’s statement in accordance with US regulations. In addition, if the
					buyer calls AWS Support because the buyer needs to contact you for an
					invoice or for some other tax-related reason, AWS might need to provide the
					buyer with your email address so that the buyer can contact you
					directly.</p>
				<p>For similar reasons, the buyer's ZIP code and country information are
					provided to the seller in the disbursement report. As a seller, you might
					need this information to accompany any necessary transaction taxes that you
					remit to the government (such as sales tax and value-added tax).</p>
				<p>AWS cannot offer tax advice, but if your tax specialist determines that
					you need specific additional information, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>contact AWS Support</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
