With Session Manager, you can manage your
        Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs).
        You can use either an interactive one-click browser-based shell or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
        Session Manager provides secure and auditable node management without the need to open inbound
        ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys. Session Manager also allows you to comply with
        corporate policies that require controlled access to managed nodes, strict security
        practices, and fully auditable logs with node access details, while providing end users with
        simple one-click cross-platform access to your managed nodes. To get started with Session Manager,
        open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/session-manager" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Systems Manager console</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.
        In the navigation pane, choose <b>Session Manager</b>.</p>
        <h2 id="session-manager-benefits">How can Session Manager benefit my
                organization?</h2>
        <p>Session Manager offers these benefits:</p>

                </p>
                <p>Administrators have a single place to grant and revoke access to managed
                    nodes. Using only AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, you can control which individual
                    users or groups in your organization can use Session Manager and which managed nodes
                    they can access. </p>

                <p>Leaving inbound SSH ports and remote PowerShell ports open on
                    your managed nodes greatly increases the risk of entities running unauthorized
                    or malicious commands on the managed nodes. Session Manager helps you improve your
                    security posture by letting you close these inbound ports, freeing you from
                    managing SSH keys and certificates, bastion hosts, and jump boxes.</p>

                    command or a sequence of commands. Because permissions to managed nodes are
                    provided through IAM policies instead of SSH keys or other mechanisms, the

                <p>You can work with Session Manager in the following ways:</p>
                <p>The <b>AWS Systems Manager console</b> includes access to all
                    the Session Manager capabilities for both administrators and end users. You can perform
                    any task that is related to your sessions by using the Systems Manager console. </p>
                <p>The Amazon EC2 console provides the ability for end users to connect to the EC2
                    instances for which they have been granted session permissions.</p>
                <p>The <b>AWS CLI</b> includes access to Session Manager
                    capabilities for end users. You can start a session, view a list of sessions,
                    and permanently end a session by using the AWS CLI. </p>

                        1.16.12 of the CLI (or later), and you must have installed the
                        Session Manager plugin on your local machine. For information, see <a href="./session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html">Install the Session Manager plugin

                <p>The <b>Session Manager SDK</b> consists of libraries and
                    sample code that allows application developers to build front-end applications,
                    such as custom shells or self-service portals for internal users that natively
                    use Session Manager to connect to managed nodes. Developers and partners can integrate
                    Session Manager into their client-side tooling or Automation workflows using the
                    Session Manager APIs. You can even build custom solutions.</p>

                    access. You can also provide temporary access to your managed nodes. For
                    example, you might want to give an on-call engineer (or a group of on-call
                    engineers) access to production servers only for the duration of their
                    rotation.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-a-session">What is a session?</h2>
        <p>A session is a connection made to a managed node using Session Manager. Sessions are based on a
            secure bi-directional communication channel between the client (you) and the remote managed node 
            that streams inputs and outputs for commands. Traffic between a client and a managed node is 
            encrypted using TLS 1.2, and requests to create the connection are signed using Sigv4. This two-way 
            communication allows interactive bash and PowerShell access to managed nodes. You can also use an 
            AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to further encrypt data beyond the default TLS encryption.</p>
        <p>For example, say that John is an on-call engineer in your IT department. He receives
            notification of an issue that requires him to remotely connect to a managed node, such
            as a failure that requires troubleshooting or a directive to change a simple
            configuration option on a node. Using the AWS Systems Manager console, the Amazon EC2 console, or the
            AWS CLI, John starts a session connecting him to the managed node, runs commands on the
            node needed to complete the task, and then ends the session.</p>
        <p>When John sends that first command to start the session, the Session Manager service
            authenticates his ID, verifies the permissions granted to him by an IAM policy, checks
            configuration settings (such as verifying allowed limits for the sessions), and sends a
            message to SSM Agent to open the two-way connection. After the connection is established
            and John types the next command, the command output from SSM Agent is uploaded to this
            communication channel and sent back to his local machine.</p>
