        end-to-end management solution for <a href="./operating-systems-and-machine-types.html#supported-machine-types">hybrid and multicloud</a> environments that enables secure operations

        <h2 id="how-it-works">How Systems Manager works</h2>
        <p>The following diagram describes how some Systems Manager capabilities perform actions on your
            resources. The diagram doesn't cover all capabilities. Each enumerated interaction is
            described before the diagram.</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
             
             
             
             
             
        <ol><li>
                <p><b>Access Systems Manager</b> – Use one of the
                    available options for <a href="#access-methods">accessing
                    Systems Manager</a>.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><b>Choose a Systems Manager capability</b> – Determine
                    which capability can help you perform the action you want to perform on your
                    resources. The diagram shows only a few of the capabilities that IT
                    administrators and DevOps personnel use to manage their applications and
                    resources.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><b>Verification and processing</b> – Systems Manager
                    verifies that your user, group, or role has the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
                    permissions to perform the action you specified. If the target of your action is
                    a managed node, the Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) running on the node performs the
                    action. For other types of resources, Systems Manager performs the specified action or
                    communicates with other AWS services to perform the action on behalf of
                    Systems Manager.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><b>Reporting</b> – Systems Manager, SSM Agent, and other
                    AWS services that performed an action on behalf of Systems Manager report status. Systems Manager
                    can send status details to other AWS services, if configured.</p>
            </li><li>
                <p><b>Systems Manager operations management capabilities</b>
                    – If enabled, Systems Manager operations management capabilities such as Explorer,
                    OpsCenter, and Incident Manager aggregate operations data or create artifacts in
                    response to events or errors with your resources. These artifacts include
                    operational work items (OpsItems) and incidents. Systems Manager operations management
                    capabilities provide operational insight into your applications and resources
                    and automated remediation solutions to help troubleshoot problems.</p>

                            the context of their applications and clusters. In Application Manager, an
                                <em>application</em> is a logical group of AWS
                            resources that you want to operate as a unit. This logical group can
                            represent different versions of an application, ownership boundaries for
                            operators, or developer environments, to name a few. Application Manager support
                            for container clusters includes both Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service
                            (Amazon ECS) clusters. Application Manager aggregates operations information from
                            multiple AWS services and Systems Manager capabilities to a single

                            containers, mobile applications, or edge devices. To prevent errors when
                            deploying application configurations, AppConfig includes validators. A
                            validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to verify that the
                            configuration you want to deploy works as intended. During a
                            configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to verify
                            that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error or
                            if the deployment invokes an alarm, AppConfig rolls back the change to
                            minimize impact for your application users.</p>
