		<h2 id="infrastructure-security">Infrastructure security in Launch Wizard</h2>

		<p>As a managed service, AWS Launch Wizard is protected by the AWS global network security. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Cloud Security</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see
			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html">Infrastructure Protection</a> in <em>Security Pillar AWS Well‐Architected Framework</em>.</p>
	 
		<h2 id="disaster-recovery-resiliency">Resilience in Launch Wizard</h2>
		<p>The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
			Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are
			connected through low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With
			Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that
			automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability
			Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or
			multiple data center infrastructures.</p>
		<p>For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Global
				Infrastructure</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
		<p>AWS Launch Wizard sets up an application across multiple Availability Zones to ensure
			automatic failover between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones
			are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or
			multiple datacenter infrastructures. </p>
	 
		<h2 id="data-protection">Data protection in Launch Wizard</h2> 
<p>The AWS <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>shared responsibility model</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>
   applies to data protection in AWS Launch Wizard. As described in this model, AWS is
   responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS Cloud. You are
   responsible for maintaining control over your content that is hosted on this infrastructure.
   This content includes the security configuration and management tasks for the AWS services
   that you use. For more information about data privacy, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Data Privacy FAQ</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.<span> For information about data protection in Europe, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Shared
            Responsibility Model and GDPR</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> blog post on the <em>AWS Security
               Blog</em>.</span></p>
     <p>For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account
     credentials and set up individual users with AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). That way, each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
     
     
     
     
<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering
            and securing sensitive data that is stored in Amazon S3.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>If you require FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through
            a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. For more information about the
            available FIPS endpoints, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Federal
                Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
    </li></ul></div> 
    <p>We strongly recommend that you never put confidential or sensitive information, such as your
        customers' email addresses, into tags or free-form text fields such as a <b>Name</b> field. This includes when you work with Launch Wizard or other AWS services 
        using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Any data that you enter into
        tags or free-form text fields used for names may be used for billing or diagnostic logs. If you 
        provide a URL to an external server, we strongly recommend that you do not include credentials 
        information in the URL to validate your request to that server.</p>
  
			<h3 id="key-management">Encryption with AWS managed keys and
					customer managed keys</h3>
			<p>AWS Launch Wizard for Active Directory, SQL Server, and SAP use the default
				AWS managed keys to encrypt Amazon EBS volumes. Launch Wizard for SAP also supports the use of
				customer managed keys that you have already created.</p>
			<p>If you don't specify a customer managed key, Launch Wizard for SAP automatically creates an
				AWS managed key in your AWS account.</p>
			<p>If you want to use a customer managed key for Launch Wizard for SAP, see the steps for adding
				permissions to your KMS key policy for Launch Wizard to use your KMS key at <a href="./launch-wizard-sap-setting-up.html#launch-wizard-sap-iam-encryption">Add permissions to use
                        AWS KMS keys</a> in the <em>Launch Wizard for SAP
					User Guide</em>.</p>
			<p>Creating your own customer managed CMK gives you more flexibility and control. For
				example, you can create, rotate, and disable customer managed keys. You can also define access
				controls and audit the customer managed keys that you use to protect your data. For more
				information about customer managed keys and AWS managed keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html">AWS KMS
					concepts</a> in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.</p>
