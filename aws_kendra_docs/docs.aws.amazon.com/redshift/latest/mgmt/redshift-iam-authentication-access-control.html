      <h2 id="security_iam_authentication">Authenticating with identities</h2>
      
   
<p>Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. You must be
<em>authenticated</em> (signed in to AWS) as the AWS account root user, as an
IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role.</p>

<p>You can sign in to AWS as a federated identity by using credentials provided through an identity source.
AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center) users, your company's single sign-on authentication, and your Google or Facebook
credentials are examples of federated identities. When you sign in as a federated identity, your administrator previously set up identity federation using IAM roles. When you access AWS by using federation, you are indirectly assuming a role.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the AWS access
portal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html">How to sign in to your AWS account</a>
in the <em>AWS Sign-In User Guide</em>.</p>

<p>If you access AWS programmatically, AWS provides a software development kit (SDK) and a
command line interface (CLI) to cryptographically sign your requests using your credentials. If
you don't use AWS tools, you must sign requests yourself. For more information about using the recommended method
to sign requests yourself, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 signing process</a> in
the <em>AWS General Reference</em>.</p>

<p>Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might be required to provide
additional security information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor
authentication (MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html">Multi-factor authentication</a> in the
<em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>


  
       
        <h3 id="security_iam_authentication-rootuser">AWS account root user</h3>
        <p>

 When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services
 and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account <em>root user</em> and is accessed by
 signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We 
 strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to
 perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">Tasks that require root user credentials</a> in the <em>AWS Account Management Reference Guide</em>.
 </p>
       
       
        <h3 id="security_iam_authentication-iamuser">IAM users and groups</h3>
        
   
         <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. However, if you have specific use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate access keys. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials">Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-term credentials</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         
         <p>An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html"><em>IAM group</em></a> is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users.
            You can't sign in as a group. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for
            large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named <em>IAMAdmins</em> and give that group permissions to administer IAM
            resources.</p>
         <p>Users are different from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone
            who needs it. Users have permanent long-term credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_which-to-choose">When to create an IAM user (instead of a role)</a> in the
               <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
  
       
       
        <h3 id="security_iam_authentication-iamrole">IAM roles</h3>
        
   
         <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that
            has specific permissions. It is similar to an IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in
            the AWS Management Console by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html">switching roles</a>. You can assume a role by calling an AWS CLI
            or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information about methods for using roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM roles</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         <p>IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:</p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            
             
             
             
             
             
         <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
               <p><b>Federated user access</b> – 

To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role and define permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by the role. For information about roles for federation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html">

<span>If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set. To control what your identities can access after they authenticate, IAM Identity Center correlates the permission set to a role in IAM.

                  resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account
                  access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a
                  resource (instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the difference between
                  roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How IAM roles

      Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, 
      it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this 
      using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role.

               <p><b>Applications running on Amazon EC2</b> –

      You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. 
      This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it 
      available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the 
      instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to
      get temporary credentials. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances</a> in the
