    <h2 id="eb-receiving-events-from-another-account">Grant permissions to allow events
        from other AWS accounts</h2>
    <p>To receive events from other accounts or organizations, you must first edit the permissions on the event bus where you intend to receive events. 
      The default event bus accepts events from AWS services, other authorized AWS accounts, and
        <code class="code">PutEvents</code> calls. The permissions for an event bus are granted or denied using
      a resource-based policy attached to the event bus. In the policy, you can grant permissions to
      other AWS accounts using the account ID, or to an AWS organization using the organization ID.
      To learn more about event bus permissions, including example policies, see <a href="./eb-event-bus-perms.html">Permissions for Amazon EventBridge event buses</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>EventBridge now requires all new cross account event bus targets to add IAM roles. 
      This only applies to event bus targets created after March 2, 2023. 
      Applications created without an IAM role before that date are not affected.
      However, we recommend adding IAM roles to grant users access to resources in another account, 
      as this ensures organization boundaries using Service Control Policies (SCPs) are applied to determine who can send and receive events from accounts in your organization.
    </p></div></div>

    <div class="awsdocs-note awsdocs-important"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-warning" variant="error"></awsui-icon><h6>Important</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>If you choose to receive events from all AWS accounts, be careful to create rules that
        match only the events to receive from others. To create more secure rules, make sure that
        the event pattern for each rule contains an <code class="code">Account</code> field with the account IDs
        of one or more accounts from which to receive events. Rules that have an event pattern
        containing an Account field do not match events sent from accounts that are not listed in
        the <code class="code">Account</code> field. For more information, see <a href="./eb-events.html">Amazon EventBridge events</a>.</p></div></div>
   
    <h2 id="eb-writing-rules-that-match-events-from-another-account">Rules for events
        between AWS accounts</h2>

    <p>If your account is set up to receive events from event buses in other AWS accounts, you can write rules
      that match those events. Set the <a href="./eb-event-patterns.html">event
        pattern</a> of the rule to match the events you are
      receiving from event buses in the other account.</p>
    <p>Unless you specify <code class="code">account</code> in the event pattern of a rule, any of your
      account's rules, both new and existing, that match events you receive from event buses in other accounts
      trigger based on those events. If you are receiving events from event buses in another account, and you want
      a rule to trigger only on that event pattern when it is generated from your own account, you
      must add <code class="code">account</code> and specify your own account ID to the event pattern of the
      rule.</p>
    <p>If you set up your AWS account to accept events from event buses in all AWS accounts, we strongly
      recommend that you add <code class="code">account</code> to every EventBridge rule in your account. This prevents
      rules in your account from triggering on events from unknown AWS accounts. When you specify
      the <code class="code">account</code> field in the rule, you can specify the account IDs of more than one
      AWS account in the field.</p>
    <p>To have a rule trigger on a matching event from any event buses in AWS account that you have granted
      permissions to, do not specify * in the <code class="code">account</code> field of the rule. Doing so would
      not match any events, because * never appears in the <code class="code">account</code> field of an event.
      Instead, just omit the <code class="code">account</code> field from the rule.</p>
