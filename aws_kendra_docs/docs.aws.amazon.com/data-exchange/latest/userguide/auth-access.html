        subscribing to a product in the AWS Data Exchange console, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) requires that you
        authenticate that you're an approved AWS user. For example, if you're using the AWS Data Exchange
        console, you authenticate your identity by providing your AWS sign-in credentials.</p><p>After you authenticate your identity, IAM controls your access to AWS with a defined
        set of permissions on a set of operations and resources. If you're an account administrator,
        you can use IAM to control the access of other users to the resources that are associated
        with your account.</p><div class="highlights"><h6>Topics</h6><ul><li><a href="#authentication">Authentication</a></li><li><a href="./access-control.html">Access control</a></li><li><a href="./api-permissions-ref.html">AWS Data Exchange API permissions: actions and resources

 When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services
 and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account <em>root user</em> and is accessed by
 signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We 
 strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to
 perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">Tasks that require root user credentials</a> in the <em>AWS Account Management Reference Guide</em>.

    An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> is an IAM identity that 
    you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to 
    an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine 
    what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated 
    with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role 
    does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated 
    with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials 
    for your role session.
 
                    
                    Roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:</p>

                            of creating a user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your
                            enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known
                            as <em>federated users</em>. AWS assigns a role to a
                            federated user when access is requested through an identity provider.
                            For more information about federated users, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_access-management.html#intro-access-roles">Federated Users and Roles</a>.</p>

                        <p><b>AWS service access</b> – A
                            service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions
                            in your account on your behalf. When you set up some AWS service
                            environments, you must define a role for the service to assume. This
                            service role must include all the permissions that are required for the
                            service to access the AWS resources that it needs. Service roles vary
                            from service to service, but many allow you to choose your permissions
                            as long as you meet the documented requirements for that service.
                            Service roles provide access only within your account and cannot be used
                            to grant access to services in other accounts. You can create, modify,
                            and delete a service role from within IAM. For example, you can create
                            a role that allows Amazon Redshift to access an Amazon S3 bucket on your behalf and then
                            load data from that bucket into an Amazon Redshift cluster. For more information,
                            see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html">Creating
                                a Role to Delegate Permissions to an AWS Service</a>.</p>

                            You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for
                            applications that are running on an Amazon EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or
                            AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys in the
                            Amazon EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an Amazon EC2 instance and make it
                            available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile
                            that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role
                            and enables programs that are running on the Amazon EC2 instance to get
                            temporary credentials. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM
