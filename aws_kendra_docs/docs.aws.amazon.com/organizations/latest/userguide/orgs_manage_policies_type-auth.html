        manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum
        available permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure your
        accounts stay within your organization’s access control guidelines. SCPs are available only
        in an organization that has <a href="./orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">all
            features enabled</a>. SCPs aren't available if your organization has enabled only the
        consolidated billing features. For instructions on enabling SCPs, see <a href="./orgs_manage_policies_enable-disable.html">Enabling and disabling policy
            types</a>.</p><p>SCPs alone are not sufficient to granting permissions to the accounts in your
        organization. No permissions are granted by an SCP. An SCP defines a guardrail, or sets
        limits, on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and
        roles in the affected accounts. The administrator must still attach <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html">identity-based or
            resource-based policies</a> to IAM users or roles, or to the resources in your
        accounts to actually grant permissions. The <a href="#scp-effects-on-permissions">effective permissions</a> are the logical intersection between what is allowed by
        the SCP and what is allowed by the IAM and resource-based policies.</p><div class="awsdocs-note awsdocs-important"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-warning" variant="error"></awsui-icon><h6>Important</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account.

        <h2 id="scp-warning-testing-effect">Testing effects of SCPs</h2>
        <p>AWS strongly recommends that you don't attach SCPs to the root of your organization
            without thoroughly testing the impact that the policy has on accounts. Instead, create
            an OU that you can move your accounts into one at a time, or at least in small numbers,
            to ensure that you don't inadvertently lock users out of key services. One way to
            determine whether a service is used by an account is to examine the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">service last accessed data
                in IAM</a>. Another way is to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/how-cloudtrail-works.html">use AWS CloudTrail to log service usage at
                the API level</a>.</p>
     
        <h2 id="scp-size-limit">Maximum size of SCPs</h2>
        <p>All characters in your SCP count against its <a href="./orgs_reference_limits.html#min-max-values">maximum
                size</a>. The examples in this guide show the SCPs formatted with extra white
            space to improve their readability. However, to save space if your policy size
            approaches the maximum size, you can delete any white space, such as space characters
            and line breaks that are outside quotation marks.</p>
        <div class="awsdocs-note awsdocs-tip"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Tip</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>Use the visual editor to build your SCP. It automatically removes extra white
                space.</p></div></div>
     
        <h2 id="scp-about-inheritance">Inheritance of SCPs in the OU hierarchy</h2>
        <p>For a detailed explanation of how SCP inheritance works, see <a href="./orgs_manage_policies_inheritance_auth.html">Inheritance for service control
            policies</a></p>
     
        <h2 id="scp-effects-on-permissions">SCP effects on permissions</h2>
        <p>SCPs are similar to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission policies and use almost the same
            syntax. However, an SCP never grants permissions. Instead, SCPs are JSON policies that
            specify the maximum permissions for the affected accounts. For more information, see
                <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html">Policy
                Evaluation Logic</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>. </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

                    of the organization. SCPs don't affect resource-based policies directly. They
                    also don't affect users or roles from accounts outside the organization. For
                    example, consider an Amazon S3 bucket that's owned by account A in an organization.
                    The bucket policy (a resource-based policy) grants access to users from account
                    B outside the organization. Account A has an SCP attached. That SCP doesn't
                    apply to those outside users in account B. The SCP applies only to users that
                    are managed by account A in the organization. </p>

        <h2 id="data-from-iam">Using access data to improve SCPs</h2>
        <p>When signed in with management account credentials, you can view <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">service last accessed
                data</a> for an AWS Organizations entity or policy in the <b>AWS Organizations</b>
            section of the IAM console. You can also use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API in
            IAM to retrieve service last accessed data. This data includes information about which
            allowed services that the IAM users and roles in an AWS Organizations account last attempted to
            access and when. You can use this information to identify unused permissions so that you
            can refine your SCPs to better adhere to the principle of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege">least
                privilege</a>.</p>
        <p>For example, you might have a <a href="./orgs_manage_policies_scps_strategies.html#orgs_policies_denylist">deny list
                SCP</a> that prohibits access to three AWS services. All services that aren't
            listed in the SCP's <code class="code">Deny</code> statement are allowed. The service last accessed
            data in IAM tells you which AWS services are allowed by the SCP but are never used.
            With that information, you can update the SCP to deny access to services that you don't
            need.</p>
