                    <p>You can combine your existing accounts into an organization that enables
                        you to manage the accounts centrally. You can create accounts that
                        automatically are a part of your organization, and you can invite other
                        accounts to join your organization. You also can attach policies that affect
                        some or all of your accounts. </p>

                <dd>
                    <p>Consolidated billing is a feature of AWS Organizations. You can use the management
                        account of your organization to consolidate and pay for all member accounts.
                        In consolidated billing, management accounts can also access the billing
                        information, account information, and account activity of member accounts in
                        their organization. This information may be used for services such as Cost
                        Explorer, which can help management accounts improve their organization’s
                        cost performance. </p>

                <dd>
                    <p>You can group your accounts into organizational units (OUs) and attach
                        different access policies to each OU. For example, if you have accounts that
                        must access only the AWS services that meet certain regulatory
                        requirements, you can put those accounts into one OU. You then can attach a
                        policy to that OU that blocks access to services that do not meet those
                        regulatory requirements. You can nest OUs within other OUs to a depth of
                        five levels, providing flexibility in how you structure your account
                        groups.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p>As an administrator of the management account of an organization, you can
                        use service control policies (SCPs) to specify the maximum permissions for
                        member accounts in the organization. In SCPs, you can restrict which AWS
                        services, resources, and individual API actions the users and roles in each
                        member account can access. You can also define conditions for when to
                        restrict access to AWS services, resources, and API actions. These
                        restrictions even override the administrators of member accounts in the
                        organization. When AWS Organizations blocks access to a service, resource, or API
                        action for a member account, a user or role in that account can't access it.
                        This block remains in effect even if an administrator of a member account
                        explicitly grants such permissions in an IAM policy. </p>

                    <p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html">IAM</a> provides
                        granular control over users and roles in individual accounts. AWS Organizations
                        expands that control to the account level by giving you control over what
                        users and roles in an account or a group of accounts can do. The resulting
                        permissions are the logical intersection of what is allowed by AWS Organizations at
                        the account level and the permissions that are explicitly granted by IAM
                        at the user or role level within that account. In other words, the user can
                        access only what is allowed by <em><b>both</b></em> the AWS Organizations policies and IAM
                        policies. If either blocks an operation, the user can't access that
                        operation.</p>

                <dd>
                    <p>You can leverage the multi-account management services available in
                        AWS Organizations with select AWS services to perform tasks on all accounts that
                        are members of an organization. For a list of services and the benefits of
                        using each service on an organization-wide level, see <a href="./orgs_integrate_services_list.html">AWS services that you can use with
            AWS Organizations</a>. </p>
                    <p>When you enable an AWS service to perform tasks on your behalf in your
                        organization's member accounts, AWS Organizations creates an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-an-easier-way-to-delegate-permissions-to-aws-services-service-linked-roles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>IAM service-linked role</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> for that service in each member
                        account. The service-linked role has predefined IAM permissions that allow
                        the other AWS service to perform specific tasks in your organization and
                        its accounts. For this to work, all accounts in an organization
                        automatically have a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#iam-term-service-linked-role">service-linked role</a>. This role enables the AWS Organizations service to
                        create the service-linked roles required by AWS services for which you
                        enable trusted access. These additional service-linked roles are attached to
                        IAM permission policies that enable the specified service to perform only
                        those tasks that are required by your configuration choices. For more
                        information, see <a href="./orgs_integrate_services.html">Using AWS Organizations with other AWS services</a>.</p>

                        data across multiple servers in AWS data centers within its Region. If a
