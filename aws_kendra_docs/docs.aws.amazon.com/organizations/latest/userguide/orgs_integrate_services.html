        you specify, called the <em>trusted service</em>, to perform tasks
        in your organization and its accounts on your behalf. This involves granting permissions to
        the trusted service but does <em>not</em> otherwise affect the
        permissions for users or roles. When you enable access, the trusted service can create
        an IAM role called a <em>service-linked role</em> in every account in your
        organization whenever that role is needed. That role has a permissions policy that allows
        the trusted service to do the tasks that are described in that service's documentation. This
        enables you to specify settings and configuration details that you would like the trusted
        service to maintain in your organization's accounts on your behalf. The trusted service only
        creates service-linked roles when it needs to perform management actions on accounts, and
        not necessarily in all accounts of the organization. </p><a id="important-note-about-integration"></a><div class="awsdocs-note awsdocs-important"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-warning" variant="error"></awsui-icon><h6>Important</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>We <b><em>strongly recommend</em></b> that you

        <h2 id="orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs">AWS Organizations and service-linked
                roles</h2>
        <p>AWS Organizations uses <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-an-easier-way-to-delegate-permissions-to-aws-services-service-linked-roles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>IAM service-linked roles</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> to enable trusted services to perform tasks on
            your behalf in your organization's member accounts. When you configure a trusted service
            and authorize it to integrate with your organization, that service can request that
            AWS Organizations create a service-linked role in its member account. The trusted service does
            this asynchronously as needed and not necessarily in all accounts in the organization at
            the same time. The service-linked role has predefined IAM permissions that allow the
            trusted service to perform only specific tasks within that account. In general, AWS
            manages all service-linked roles, which means that you typically can't alter the roles
            or the attached policies. </p>
        <p>To make all of this possible, when you create an account in an organization or you
            accept an invitation to join your existing account to an organization, AWS Organizations
            provisions the member account with a service-linked role named
                <code class="code">AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</code>. Only the AWS Organizations service itself can
            assume this role. The role has permissions that allow AWS Organizations to create service-linked
            roles for other AWS services. This service-linked role is present in all
            organizations.</p>
        <p>Although we don't recommend it, if your organization has only <a href="./orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#feature-set-cb-only">consolidated billing features</a> enabled, the
            service-linked role named <code class="code">AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</code> is never used, and
            you can delete it. If you later want to enable <a href="./orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#feature-set-all">all
                features</a> in your organization, the role is required, and you must restore it.
            The following checks occur when you begin the process to enable all features:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

                    permission to agree to the request. When the administrator agrees to the
                    request, AWS Organizations creates the service-linked role if it doesn't already exist.
