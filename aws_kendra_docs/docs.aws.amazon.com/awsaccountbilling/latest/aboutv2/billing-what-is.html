                    <p>The Billing service and AWS Cost Management service is closely integrated with
                        AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). You can use IAM with Billing to ensure that other
                        people who work in your account have as much access as they need to get
                        their jobs done.</p>
                    
                    <p>You also use IAM to control access to all of your AWS resources, not
                        only your billing information. It's important that you familiarize yourself
                        with the major concepts and best practices of IAM before you get too far
                        along with setting up the structure of your AWS account.</p>

                    <p>You can use AWS products and services to accommodate a company of any
                        size, from small start-ups to enterprises. If your company is large or
                        likely to grow, you might want to set up multiple AWS accounts that
                        reflect your company's specific structure. For example, you can have one
                        account for the entire company and accounts for each employee, or an account
                        for the entire company with IAM users for each employee. You can have an
                        account for the entire company, accounts for each department or team within
                        the company, and accounts for each employee.</p>
                    <p>If you create multiple accounts, you can use the consolidated billing
                        feature of AWS Organizations to combine all member accounts under a
                        management account. That way, you can receive a single bill for all of your
                        member accounts. For more information, see <a href="./consolidated-billing.html">Consolidated billing for AWS Organizations</a>.</p>
