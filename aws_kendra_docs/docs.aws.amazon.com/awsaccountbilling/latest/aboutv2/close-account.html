			<h3 id="aws-agreement"><span>Your agreement with AWS services</span></h3>
			<p><span>Your closure of your AWS account serves as a notice to us that you want to terminate the
				AWS service customer agreement or other agreements with AWS services that governs your AWS account, solely with respect to the specific AWS account. </span>If you reopen your AWS account during the <em>post-closure period</em> (that is, within 90 days
				after your account is closed), you agree that the same agreement terms will govern
				your access to and use of the service offerings through your reopened
				AWS account.</p>
			<p>If you close the account that you're using for the AWS Firewall Manager administrator, AWS services and Firewall Manager handle the closure as follows:</p>
			
			
<p>
    AWS retains the policy data for the account for 90 days from the effective date of the administrator account closure.  
    At the end of the 90 day period, AWS permanently deletes all policy data for the account.
</p>

<div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            To retain findings for more than 90 days, you can archive the policies.  You can also use a custom action with 
            an EventBridge rule to store the findings in an S3 bucket.
        </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>
            As long as AWS retains the policy data, when you reopen the closed account, AWS reassigns the account 
            as the service  administrator and recovers the service policy data for the account.
        </p>

			<h3 id="console-access"><span>AWS management console access</span></h3>
			<p>Your access to the AWS Management Console for the closed AWS account is restricted. During the
				post-closure period, you can still sign in to your AWS account to view your past
				billing information and access AWS Support. You can't access any other AWS services
				or start any new AWS services in the closed account.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h3 id="existing-content">Existing content and services still in use</h3>
			<p>Before you close your AWS account, we recommend that you retrieve the content that you want to keep and delete the remaining resources. For instructions on how to retrieve data and delete resources, see the documentation for that service.</p>
			<p>After the post-closure period, any remaining content in your AWS account is deleted, and
				services that are still in use are terminated. For more information about the
				post-closure period, see <a href="#accessing-after-closure">Accessing your AWS account after closure</a>.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h3 id="closure-payment">Your payment method</h3>
			<p>We charge you through your designated payment method for any usage fees incurred before you
				closed your AWS account. We might issue you any refunds that are due through that
				same payment method. If you have active subscriptions, even after your account is
				closed, you might continue to be charged for the subscription until the subscription
				expires or is sold according to the terms governing the subscription. If you're
				charged, you're charged through your designated payment method. This situation might
				apply to you if, for example, you have a Reserved Instance that you pay for on a
				monthly basis. These charges and refunds might occur after you close your
				account.</p> 
			<p>In addition, if you reopen your account, you might be charged for the cost of running AWS service
				services during the post-closure period. This is specifically for any services that
				you didn't terminate before closing your account.</p>

			<h3 id="mfa-closure">Accounts protected by MFA</h3>
			<p><span>If you've turned on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> on your AWS account root user, or configured an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_sign-in-mfa.html">MFA device on an IAM user</a>, the MFA isn't removed automatically when you close the account. </span>If you choose to leave the MFA turned on during the 90 days post-closure period, keep the virtual hardware MFA device active until the post-closure period expired in case you need to access the account during that time.</p>
			<p>You have the option to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_disable.html">turn off the MFA device</a> before closing the account. MFA devices for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting">IAM users</a> must be deleted by the account administrator.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h3 id="on-demand-closure">On-Demand charges</h3>
			<p>During the post-closure period, billing for On-Demand charges stops. However, you're billed
				for any usage that has accrued up until the time you closed your account. You'll be
				charged for that usage at the beginning of the next month. In addition, if you
				purchased any subscriptions with ongoing payment obligations, you might continue to
				be charged for them after your account is closed.</p>

			<h3 id="closure-domains">Domains registered with Amazon Route 53</h3>
			<p>Domains that are registered with Route 53 are not deleted automatically. When you're closing
				your AWS account, you have three options:</p>
			<div class="itemizedlist">
				 
				 
				 
			<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
					<p>You can disable automatic renewal, and the domains are deleted when the registration
						period expires. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-enable-disable-auto-renewal.html">Enabling or Disabling Automatic Renewal for a Domain</a> in the
							<em>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</em>.</p>
				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>You can transfer the domains to another AWS account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-between-aws-accounts.html">Transferring a Domain to a Different AWS account</a>.</p>

				</li></ul></div>
			
			<p>If you already closed the account, you can open a case with AWS Support to get help with
				disabling automatic renewal or transferring your domains. For more information, see
					<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-contact-support.html">Contacting AWS Support About Domain Registration Issues</a>. There is no charge to open a
				case for domain registration issues.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h3 id="reopen-charges">Charges if you reopen your AWS account</h3>
			<p>If you reopen your AWS account during the post-closure period, you might be billed for
				the cost of any AWS services that aren't terminated before you closed your
				account.</p>
			 
				<h4 id="reopen-charges-example">Example</h4>
				<p>You reopen your AWS account 30 days after closure, and your AWS account had only an
					active <code class="code">t-example.example</code> Amazon EC2 instance at closure. The price for a
						<code class="code">t-example.example</code> Amazon EC2 instance in your AWS Region is
					$0.01 each hour. In this case, you might be charged for 30 days x 24
					hours x $0.01 per hour = $7.20 for your AWS services.</p>
			 
		 
		
		 
			<h3 id="closing-member-account">Closing a member account</h3>

			<p>When you close an account that was created with AWS Organizations, that account isn't removed from
				the organization until after the post-closure period. During the post-closure
				period, a closed member account still counts toward your quota of accounts in the
				organization.</p>
			<p>To avoid having the account count against the limit, remove member accounts from the organization before closing it. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html">Closing an AWS account</a> in the <em>AWS Organizations User Guide</em>.</p>

		 
		
		 
			<h3 id="cross-access">Cross-account access to the account you’re closing</h3>
			<p>After you close your AWS account, any access requests to your closed account's AWS service
				services from other AWS accounts fail. This occurs even if you have granted the
				other accounts permission to access your account's AWS services. If you reopen
				your AWS account, other AWS accounts can access your account's AWS services if
				you have granted the other accounts the necessary permissions.</p>
		 
		
		 
			<h3 id="vpc-peering">Removing Amazon VPC peering connection</h3>
			<p>AWS services currently doesn't delete Amazon VPC peering connections when you close one of the accounts
				participating in the VPC peering connection. Any traffic that's destined for the VPC
				peering connection and originates from other active accounts is dropped. This is
				because AWS services terminates instances and deletes any security groups in the closed
				account. To remove the VPC peering connection, you can delete it from your account
				using the Amazon VPC console, AWS CLI, or Amazon EC2 API.</p>
		 
	 
		<h2 id="troubleshooting-closing">Troubleshooting errors when closing an AWS account</h2>
		<p>If you receive an error message while trying to close your AWS account, you can contact
			your account representative or contact us to open a billing or account support case.
			Common reasons why you can't close your AWS account include the following
			situations:</p>
		<div class="itemizedlist">
			 
			 
			 
			 
		<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
				<p>Your account is the management account of an organization in AWS Organizations with open member

			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>You are an active AWS Marketplace seller.</p>
			</li></ul></div>
	 
		<h2 id="closing-the-account">Closing your AWS account</h2>
		<p>You can close your AWS account using the following procedure.</p>
		<div class="procedure"><a id="closing-the-account-proc"></a><h6>To close your AWS account</h6><ol><li>
				<p>Open the Billing and Cost Management console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>

			</li><li>
				<p>Scroll to the end of the page to the <b>Close Account</b> section. Read and
					ensure that you understand the text next to the check box. After you close an
					AWS account, you can no longer use it to access AWS services.</p> 
				<p>If the account has a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> device turned on, keep your MFA
					device until the 90 day post-closure period expires, or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_disable.html">turn off</a> before closing the account.</p>

				<p>In the confirmation box, choose <b>Close Account</b>.</p>
			</li></ol></div>
	 
		<h2 id="accessing-after-closure">Accessing your AWS account after closure</h2>

		<p>After you close an AWS account following the process described in the preceding steps, you
			can no longer use it to access AWS services. However, during the Post-Closure Period,
			which are the 90 days after your account is closed, you can still view your
			AWS account's past billing information and access <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Support</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. Your Amazon EC2 instances can be
			stopped after your account has been closed. If you reopen your account, you might need
			to restart your Amazon EC2 instances.</p>
		<p>During the Post-Closure Period, AWS services might retain any content that you didn't delete and
			any AWS services that you didn't terminate before you closed your AWS account. You
			can access any remaining content or AWS services only by reopening your account during
			the Post-Closure Period. You can reopen your AWS account by contacting <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Support</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. If you choose to reopen
			your account, you can access the content that you didn't delete and AWS services that
			you didn't terminate before closing your account. However, you might be charged for the
			cost of running those AWS services during the Post-Closure Period. You can estimate
			the cost of running AWS services using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pricing-calculator/latest/userguide/what-is-pricing-calculator.html">AWS Pricing Calculator</a> in the <em>AWS Pricing Calculator User Guide</em>.</p>
	 
		<h2 id="post-closure-period">After the post-closure period</h2>
		<p>After the Post-Closure Period, we permanently close your AWS account, and you can't reopen
			it. Any content that you didn't delete is deleted, and any AWS services that you
			didn't terminate are terminated. Service attributes can be retained as long as needed
			for billing and administration purposes. You also can't create a new AWS account using
			the same alias or email address that was registered to your AWS account at the time of
			its closure.</p>
		<p>If you close the account that you're using for the AWS Firewall Manager administrator, AWS and Firewall Manager handle the closure as follows:</p>
		
		
<p>
    AWS retains the policy data for the account for 90 days from the effective date of the administrator account closure.  
    At the end of the 90 day period, AWS permanently deletes all policy data for the account.
</p>

        <p>
            To retain findings for more than 90 days, you can archive the policies.  You can also use a custom action with 
            an EventBridge rule to store the findings in an S3 bucket.

        <p>
            As long as AWS retains the policy data, when you reopen the closed account, AWS reassigns the account 
            as the service  administrator and recovers the service policy data for the account.
