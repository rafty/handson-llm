                <a href="#appinsights-components">application resources</a>. It identifies
            and sets up key metrics, logs, and alarms across your application resources and
            technology stack (for example, your Microsoft SQL Server database, web (IIS) and
            application servers, OS, load balancers, and queues). It continuously monitors metrics
            and logs to detect and correlate anomalies and errors. When errors and anomalies are
            detected, Application Insights generates <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html">CloudWatch Events</a> that you can use to set up notifications or take actions. To
            assist with troubleshooting, it creates automated dashboards for detected problems,
            which include correlated metric anomalies and log errors, along with additional insights
            to point you to a potential root cause. The automated dashboards help you to take
            remedial actions to keep your applications healthy and to prevent impact to the
            end-users of your application. It also creates OpsItems so that you can resolve problems
            using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter.html">AWS SSM OpsCenter</a>.</p><p>You can configure important counters, such as Mirrored Write Transaction/sec, Recovery

            <h2 id="appinsights-features">Features</h2>
            <p>Application Insights provides the following features.</p>
             
                <h6>Automatic set up of monitors for application resources</h6>
                <p>CloudWatch Application Insights reduces the time it takes to set up monitoring for your applications. It
                    does this by scanning your application resources, providing a customizable list
                    of recommended metrics and logs, and setting them up on CloudWatch to provide
                    necessary visibility into your application resources, such as Amazon EC2 and Elastic
                    Load Balancers (ELB). It also sets up dynamic alarms on monitored metrics. The
                    alarms are automatically updated based on anomalies detected in the previous two
                    weeks. </p>
             
             
                <h6>Problem detection and notification </h6>
                <p>CloudWatch Application Insights detects signs of potential problems with your application, such as metric
                    anomalies and log errors. It correlates these observations to surface potential
                    problems with your application. It then generates CloudWatch Events, <a href="./appinsights-cloudwatch-events.html">which can be configured to receive
                        notifications or take actions</a>. This eliminates the need for you to
                    create individual alarms on metrics or log errors. </p>
             
             
                <h6>Troubleshooting</h6>
                <p>CloudWatch Application Insights creates CloudWatch automatic dashboards for problems that are detected. The
                    dashboards show details about the problem, including the associated metric
                    anomalies and log errors to help you with troubleshooting. They also provide
                    additional insights that point to potential root causes of the anomalies and
                    errors. </p>
             
         
            <h2 id="appinsights-concepts">Concepts</h2>
            <p>The following concepts are important for understanding how Application Insights monitors
                your application.</p>
             
                <h6><a id="components"></a>Component</h6>
                <p>An auto-grouped, standalone, or custom grouping of similar resources that make
                    up an application. We recommend grouping similar resources into custom
                    components for better monitoring.</p>
             
             
                <h6>Observation</h6>
                <p>An individual event (metric anomaly, log error, or exception) that is detected
                    with an application or application resource.</p>
             
             
                <h6>Problem</h6>
                <p>Problems are detected by correlating, classifying, and grouping related
                    observations. </p>
             
            <p>For definitions of other key concepts for CloudWatch Application Insights, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html"> Amazon CloudWatch Concepts</a>.</p>
         
            <h2 id="appinsights-pricing">Pricing</h2>
            <p>CloudWatch Application Insights sets up recommended metrics and logs for selected application resources using
                CloudWatch metrics, Logs, and Events for notifications on detected problems. These
                features are charged to your AWS account according to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>CloudWatch pricing</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. For detected
                problems, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-working-with-OpsItems.html">SSM OpsItems</a> are also created by Application Insights to notify you about
                problems. Additionally, Application Insights creates <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html">SSM Parameter Store parameters</a> to configure the CloudWatch agents on your
                instances. The Amazon EC2 Systems Manager features are charged according to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>SSM pricing</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. You are not charged for
                setup assistance, monitoring, data analysis, or problem detection.</p>

                <p>The costs in this example are considered according to the following
                    scenario.</p>
                <p>You created a resource group that includes the following:</p>
                <div class="itemizedlist">

                        <p>An attached Amazon EBS volume.</p>

                <p>When you onboard this resource group with CloudWatch Application Insights, the SQL Server workload

                    <p><b>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)</b> is a managed service
                        that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without having to install,
                        operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. Kubernetes
                        is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and
                        management of containerized applications. For more information, see the

                    <p><b>Kubernetes on Amazon EC2</b>. Kubernetes is
                        open-source software that helps you deploy and manage containerized
                        applications at scale. Kubernetes manages clusters of Amazon EC2 compute
                        instances and runs containers on those instances with processes for
                        deployment, maintenance, and scaling. With Kubernetes, you can run any type
                        of containerized application with the same toolset on-premises and in the
                        cloud. For more information, see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Kubernetes Documentation: Getting started</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
