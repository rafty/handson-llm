    	<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
    			<p><b>Query your log data</b> – You can use CloudWatch Logs
					Insights to interactively search and analyze your log data. You can perform
					queries to help you more efficiently and effectively respond to operational
					issues. CloudWatch Logs Insights includes a purpose-built query language with a few simple
					but powerful commands. We provide sample queries, command descriptions, query
					autocompletion, and log field discovery to help you get started. Sample queries
					are included for several types of AWS service logs. To get started, see <a href="./AnalyzingLogData.html">Analyzing log data with CloudWatch Logs Insights</a>.</p>
    		</li><li class="listitem"><p><b>Detect and debug using Live Tail</b> – You can use 
    			Live Tail to quickly troubleshoot incidents by viewing a streaming
    			list of new log events as they are ingested. You can view, filter, and highlight ingested logs in near real time, helping you 
    			to detect and resolve issues quickly.  You can filter the logs based on terms you specify, and also highlight
    			logs that contain specified terms to help you quickly find what you are looking for.
    			For more information, see <a href="./CloudWatchLogs_LiveTail.html">Use Live Tail to view logs in near real time</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem">
    			<p><b>Monitor logs from Amazon EC2 instances</b> – You can use
					CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can
					track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a
					notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify. CloudWatch Logs
					uses your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required. For
					example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as
					"NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term
					at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache
					access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the
					data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify. Log data is encrypted while in transit
					and while it is at rest. To get started, see <a href="./CWL_GettingStarted.html">Getting started with CloudWatch Logs</a>.</p>
    		</li><li class="listitem">
    			<p><b>Monitor AWS CloudTrail logged events</b> – You can create
					alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured
					by CloudTrail and use the notification to perform troubleshooting. To get started, see
						<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cw_send_ct_events.html">Sending CloudTrail Events to
						CloudWatch Logs</a> in the <em>AWS CloudTrail User Guide</em>.</p>
    		</li><li class="listitem">
    			<p><b>Audit and mask sensitive data</b> – 
    				If you have sensitive data in your logs, you can help safeguard it with 
    				<em>data protection policies</em>. These policies
    				let you audit and mask the sensitive data. If you enable data protection, then by default, 
    				sensitive data 
    				that matches the data identifiers you select is masked. For more information, see
    				<a href="./mask-sensitive-log-data.html">Help protect sensitive log data with masking</a>.</p>
    		</li><li class="listitem">
    			<p><b>Log retention</b> – By default, logs are kept

					group, keeping the indefinite retention, or choosing a retention period between
					10 years and one day.</p>
    		</li><li class="listitem">
    			<p><b>Archive log data</b> – You can use CloudWatch Logs to store
					your log data in highly durable storage. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to
					quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the
					log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.</p>
    		</li><li class="listitem">
    			<p><b>Log Route 53 DNS queries</b> – You can use CloudWatch Logs to

		<p>The following services are used in conjunction with CloudWatch Logs:</p>
		<div class="itemizedlist">
			 
			 
			 
			 
		<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
				<p><b>AWS CloudTrail</b> is a web service that enables you to monitor the calls made
					to the CloudWatch Logs API for your account, including calls made by the AWS Management Console,
					AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and other services. When CloudTrail logging is turned on, CloudTrail
					captures API calls in your account and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket
					that you specify. Each log file can contain one or more records, depending on
					how many actions must be performed to satisfy a request. For more information
					about AWS CloudTrail, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/whatisawscloudtrail.html">What Is
						AWS CloudTrail?</a> in the <em>AWS CloudTrail User Guide</em>. For an
					example of the type of data that CloudWatch writes into CloudTrail log files, see <a href="./logging_cw_api_calls_cwl.html">Logging Amazon CloudWatch Logs API calls in AWS CloudTrail</a>.</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p><b>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</b> is a web service that helps you securely control
					access to AWS resources for your users. Use IAM to control who can use your
					AWS resources (authentication) and what resources they can use in which ways
					(authorization). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html">What Is IAM?</a> in the
						<em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p><b>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams</b> is a web service you can use for rapid and
					continuous data intake and aggregation. The type of data used includes IT
					infrastructure log data, application logs, social media, market data feeds, and
					web clickstream data. Because the response time for the data intake and
					processing is in real time, processing is typically lightweight. For more
					information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/introduction.html">What is
						Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?</a> in the <em>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</em>.</p>
			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p><b>AWS Lambda</b> is a web service you can use to build
					applications that respond quickly to new information. Upload your application
					code as Lambda functions and Lambda runs your code on high-availability compute
					infrastructure and performs all the administration of the compute resources,
					including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and
					automatic scaling, code and security patch deployment, and code monitoring and
					logging. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that
					Lambda supports. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What is AWS Lambda?</a> in the
					<em>AWS Lambda Developer Guide</em>.</p>
