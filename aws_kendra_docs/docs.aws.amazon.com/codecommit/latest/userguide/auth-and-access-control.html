        to access AWS resources, such as CodeCommit repositories, and your IAM user, which you use to
        manage your Git credentials or the SSH public key that you use for making Git connections.
        The following sections provide details on how you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> and CodeCommit to
        help secure access to your resources:</p><div class="itemizedlist">

        </li></ul></div>
        <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
        <p>Because CodeCommit repositories are Git-based and support the basic functionality of Git,
            including Git credentials, we recommend that you use an IAM user when working with
            CodeCommit. You can access CodeCommit with other identity types, but the other identity types are
            subject to limitations, as described below.</p>
        <p>Identity types:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

                <p><b>IAM user</b> – An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a> is an identity within
                    your Amazon Web Services account that has specific custom permissions. For example, an
                    IAM user can have permissions to create and manage Git credentials for
                    accessing CodeCommit repositories. <b>This is the
                        recommended user type for working with CodeCommit.</b> You can use an
                    IAM user name and password to sign in to secure AWS webpages like the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Management Console</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>, <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Discussion Forums</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>, or the

                <p>You can generate Git credentials or associate SSH public keys with your IAM
                    user, or you can install and configure <b>git-remote-codecommit</b>.
                    These are the easiest ways to set up Git to work with your CodeCommit repositories.
                    With <a href="./setting-up-gc.html">Git credentials</a>, you generate a static
                    user name and password in IAM. You then use these credentials for HTTPS
                    connections with Git and any third-party tool that supports Git user name and
                    password authentication. With SSH connections, you create public and private key
                    files on your local machine that Git and CodeCommit use for SSH authentication. You
                    associate the public key with your IAM user, and you store the private key on
                    your local machine. <b><a href="./setting-up-git-remote-codecommit.html">git-remote-codecommit</a></b> extends Git itself, and does not
                    require setting up Git credentials for the user.</p>
                <p>In addition, you can generate <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html">access keys</a> for
                    each user. Use access keys when you access AWS services programmatically,
                    either through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>one of the AWS SDKs</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>
                    or by using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. The
                    SDK and CLI tools use the access keys to cryptographically sign your requests.
                    If you don’t use the AWS tools, you must sign the requests yourself.
                    CodeCommit supports <em>Signature Version 4</em>, a
                    protocol for authenticating inbound API requests. For more information about
                    authenticating requests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> in the

                <p><b>Amazon Web Services account root user</b> – When you

                        credentials</em>, and they provide complete access to all of your
                    AWS resources. Some CodeCommit features are not available for root account users.
                    In addition, the only way to use Git with your root account is to either install
                    and configure <b>git-remote-codecommit</b> (recommended) or to
                    configure the AWS credential helper, which is included with the AWS CLI. You
                    cannot use Git credentials or SSH public-private key pairs with your root
                    account user. For these reasons, we do not recommend using your root account

                    expands the capabilities of AWS Identity and Access Management to provide a central place that brings
                    together administration of users and their access to AWS accounts and cloud
                    applications. While recommended as a best practice for most users working with
                    AWS, IAM Identity Center does not currently provide mechanisms for Git credentials or SSH
                    key pairs. These users can install and configure
                        <b>git-remote-codecommit</b> to locally clone CodeCommit
                    repositories, but not all integrated development environments (IDEs) support
                    cloning, pushing, or pulling with
                    <b>git-remote-codecommit</b>.</p>
                

<p>As a best practice, require human users, including users that require administrator access, to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS services by using temporary credentials.</p>

<p>A <em>federated identity</em> is a user from your enterprise user directory, a web identity provider, the AWS Directory Service, <span>the Identity Center directory, </span>or any user that
accesses AWS services by using credentials provided through an identity source. When federated identities access AWS accounts, they assume roles, and the roles provide temporary credentials.</p>

<p>For centralized access management, we recommend that you use AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On). You can create users and groups in IAM Identity Center, or you can connect and synchronize 
to a set of users and groups in your own identity source for use across all your AWS accounts and applications. For information 
about IAM Identity Center, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em>.</p>

         <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that
            has specific permissions. It is similar to an IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in
            the AWS Management Console by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html">switching roles</a>. You can assume a role by calling an AWS CLI
            or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information about methods for using roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM roles</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>

      Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, 
      it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this

      You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. 
      This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it 
      available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the 
      instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to

                                    permissions policy to the role that grants permissions on
                                    resources in Account A.</p>
                            </li><li>
                                <p>Account A administrator attaches a trust policy to the role
                                    identifying Account B as the principal who can assume the
                                    role.</p>
                            </li><li>
                                <p>Account B administrator can then delegate permissions to
                                    assume the role to any users in Account B. Doing this allows
                                    users in Account B to create or access resources in Account A.
                                    If you want to grant an AWS service permission to assume the
                                    role, the principal in the trust policy can also be an AWS
                                    service principal. For more information, see Delegation in

                <p>The following example policy allows a user to create a branch in a repository
                    named <code class="replaceable">MyDemoRepo</code>:</p>

                <p>To restrict the calls and resources that users in your account have access to,
                    create specific IAM policies, and then attach those policies to IAM users.

                    IAM policy statements for CodeCommit, see <a href="./customer-managed-policies.html#customer-managed-policies-identity">Customer managed identity

                <h4 id="resource-based-policies-overview">Resource-based
                        policies</h4>
                <p>Some services, such as Amazon S3, also support resource-based permissions policies.
                    For example, you can attach a resource-based policy to an S3 bucket to manage
                    access permissions to that bucket. CodeCommit doesn't support resource-based
                    policies, but you can use tags to identify resources, which you can then use in
                    IAM policies. For an example of a tag-based policy, see
                        <a href="#identity-based-policies">Identity-based policies (IAM
                        policies)</a>.

            <h3 id="resource-scoping">Resource scoping in CodeCommit</h3>
            <p>In CodeCommit, you can scope identity-based policies and permissions to resources, as
                described in <a href="#arn-formats">CodeCommit resources and operations</a>. However, you
                cannot scope the <code class="code">ListRepositories</code> permission to a resource. Instead,
                you must scope it to all resources (using the wildcard <code class="code">*</code>). Otherwise,
                the action fails. </p>
            <p>All other CodeCommit permissions can be scoped to resources.</p>
         
         
            <h3 id="actions-effects-principals">Specifying policy elements: resources,
                    actions, effects, and principals</h3>
            <p>You can create policies to allow or deny users access to resources, or allow or
                deny users to take specific actions on those resources. CodeCommit defines a set
                of public API operations that define how users work with the service, whether that
                is through the CodeCommit console, the SDKs, the AWS CLI, or by directly calling those
                APIs. To grant permissions for these API operations, CodeCommit defines a set of
                actions that you can specify in a policy. </p>
            <p>Some API operations can require permissions for more than one action. For more
                information about resources and API operations, see <a href="#arn-formats">CodeCommit resources and operations</a> and <a href="./auth-and-access-control-permissions-reference.html">CodeCommit
                permissions reference</a>.</p>
            <p>The following are the basic elements of a policy:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                 
                 
                 
                 
            <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                    <p><b>Resource</b> – To identify the resource
                        that the policy applies to, you use an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more
                        information, see <a href="#arn-formats">CodeCommit resources and operations</a>.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p><b>Action</b> – To identify resource
                        operations that you want to allow or deny, you use action keywords. For
                        example, depending on the specified <code class="code">Effect</code>, the
                            <code class="code">codecommit:GetBranch</code> permission either allows or denies the
                        user to perform the <code class="code">GetBranch</code> operation, which gets details
                        about a branch in a CodeCommit repository.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p><b>Effect</b> – You specify the effect,
                        either allow or deny, that takes place when the user requests the specific
                        action. If you don't explicitly grant access to (allow) a resource, access
                        is implicitly denied. You can also explicitly deny access to a resource to
                        make sure that a user cannot access it, even if a different policy grants
                        access.</p>
                </li><li class="listitem">
                    <p><b>Principal</b> – In identity-based
                        policies (IAM policies), the only type of policies that CodeCommit supports,
                        the user that the policy is attached to is the implicit principal. </p>
                </li></ul></div>

            <h3 id="policy-conditions">Specifying conditions in a policy</h3>
            <p>When you grant permissions, you use the access policy language for IAM to
                specify the conditions under which a policy should take effect. For example, you
                might want a policy to be applied only after a specific date. For more information
                about specifying conditions in a policy language, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#Condition">Condition</a>
                and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html">Policy
                    Grammar</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
            <p>To express conditions, you use predefined condition keys. There are no condition
                keys specific to CodeCommit. However, there are AWS-wide condition keys that
                you can use as appropriate. For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys">Available
                    Keys for Conditions</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.
