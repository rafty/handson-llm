         <p>Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These
            policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based
            policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html">Creating IAM policies</a> in the
            <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
  
         <p>With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and
            resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied.  You
            can't specify the principal in an identity-based policy because it applies to the user
            or role to which it is attached. To learn about all of the elements that you can use in a
            JSON policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html">IAM JSON
               policy elements reference</a> in the

         <p>Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resource-based policies are 
         IAM <em>role trust policies</em> and Amazon S3 <em>bucket policies</em>. In services that support resource-based policies, service 
         administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions
            a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">specify a principal</a> in a resource-based policy. Principals 
            can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.</p>
  
         <p>To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities
            in another account as the principal in a
               resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account principal to a resource-based
            policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship. When the principal and the
            resource are in different AWS accounts, an IAM administrator in the trusted account 
            must also grant the principal entity (user or role) permission to access the resource. They grant 
            permission by attaching an identity-based policy to the entity. However, if a resource-based 
            policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is 
            required. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How
               IAM roles differ from resource-based policies </a>in the

         <p>CloudTrail supports resource-based policies on channels used for CloudTrail Lake integrations with event sources outside of AWS. The
            resource-based policy for the channel defines which principal entities (accounts, users,
            roles, and federated users) can call <code class="code">PutAuditEvents</code> on the channel to deliver events to the destination event data store. For more information about 
            creating integrations with CloudTrail Lake, see <a href="./query-event-data-store-integration.html">Create an integration with an event

         <b>actions</b> on what <b>resources</b>, and under what <b>conditions</b>.</p>
  
            <p>The <code class="code">Action</code> element of a JSON policy describes the
               actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy
               actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as <em>permission-only 
               actions</em> that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. 
               These additional actions are called <em>dependent actions</em>.</p>
            <p>Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.</p>

         <p>For example, to grant someone permission to list
         tags for a trail with the <code class="code">ListTags</code> API operation, you include the
         <code class="code">cloudtrail:ListTags</code> action in their policy. Policy statements must
         include either an <code class="code">Action</code> or <code class="code">NotAction</code> element.
         CloudTrail defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can
         perform with this service.</p>
         <p>To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as

         <p>In CloudTrail, there are three resource types: trails, event data stores, and channels. Each resource has a unique Amazon
            Resource Name (ARN) associated with it. In a policy, you use an ARN to identify the
            resource that the policy applies to. CloudTrail does not currently support other resource
            types, which are sometimes referred to as subresources. </p>

         <p>The CloudTrail trail resource has the following ARN:</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">arn:$<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">Partition</code>}:cloudtrail:$<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">Region</code>}:$<span>{</span>Account}:trail/<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">TrailName</code>}</code></pre>
         <p>The CloudTrail event data store resource has the following ARN:</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">arn:$<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">Partition</code>}:cloudtrail:$<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">Region</code>}:$<span>{</span>Account}:eventdatastore/<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">EventDataStoreId</code>}</code></pre>
         <p>The CloudTrail channel resource has the following ARN:</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">arn:$<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">Partition</code>}:cloudtrail:$<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">Region</code>}:$<span>{</span>Account}:channel/<span>{</span><code class="replaceable">ChannelId</code>}</code></pre>
         <p>For more information about the format of ARNs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces</a>.</p>
         <p>For example, for an AWS account with the ID
            <code class="replaceable">123456789012</code>, to specify a trail named
               <code class="replaceable">My-Trail</code> that exists in the US East (Ohio) Region in
            your statement, use the following ARN:</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">"Resource": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:<code class="replaceable">123456789012</code>:trail/<code class="replaceable">My-Trail</code>"</code></pre>
         <p>To specify all trails that belong to a specific account in that AWS Region, use the
            wildcard (*):</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">"Resource": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:<code class="replaceable">123456789012</code>:trail/*"</code></pre>
         <p>Some CloudTrail actions, such as those for creating resources, can't be
            performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard
               (<code class="code">*</code>).</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight ">"Resource": "*"</code></pre>
         <p>Many CloudTrail API actions involve multiple resources. For example,
            <code class="code">CreateTrail</code> requires an Amazon S3 bucket for storing log files, so a user must have 
            permissions to write to the bucket. To specify multiple
            resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas. </p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">"Resource": [

         <b>actions</b> on what <b>resources</b>, and under what <b>conditions</b>.</p>
  
            <p>The <code class="code">Condition</code> element (or <code class="code">Condition</code>
               <em>block</em>) lets you specify conditions in which a
               statement is in effect. The <code class="code">Condition</code> element is optional. You can create
               conditional expressions that use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html">condition
                  operators</a>, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the
               policy with values in the request. </p>
            <p>If you specify multiple <code class="code">Condition</code> elements in a statement, or
               multiple keys in a single <code class="code">Condition</code> element, AWS evaluates them using
               a logical <code class="code">AND</code> operation. If you specify multiple values for a single
               condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical <code class="code">OR</code>
               operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are
               granted.</p>
            <p> You can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example,
               you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with
               their IAM user name. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html">IAM policy elements:

      <p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions
      based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are called <em>tags</em>. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users
      or roles) and to many AWS resources. Tagging entities and resources is the first step of ABAC. Then you 
      design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the resource that they 
      are trying to access.</p>
      <p>ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly and helps with situations where policy management becomes cumbersome.</p>
      <p>To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html">condition
         element</a> of a policy using the
         <code class="code">aws:ResourceTag/<code class="replaceable">key-name</code></code>,
         <code class="code">aws:RequestTag/<code class="replaceable">key-name</code></code>, or
         <code class="code">aws:TagKeys</code> condition keys.</p>
           <p>If a service supports all three condition keys for every resource type, then the value is <b>Yes</b> for the service. 
  If a service supports all three condition keys for only some resource types, then the value is <b>Partial</b>.</p>
  <p>For more information about ABAC, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html">What is ABAC?</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>. To view a tutorial with steps for setting up ABAC, see

         <p>Although you can attach tags to CloudTrail resources, CloudTrail only supports controlling access
            to <a href="./cloudtrail-lake.html">CloudTrail Lake</a> event data stores based on tags. You

            except a user name and password. For example, when you access AWS using your
            company's single sign-on (SSO) link, that process automatically creates temporary credentials.
            You also automatically create temporary credentials when you sign in to the console as a user and
            then switch roles. For more information about switching roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html">Switching to a role
               (console)</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         <p>You can manually create temporary credentials using the AWS CLI or AWS API. You can
            then use those temporary credentials to access AWS. AWS recommends that you
            dynamically generate temporary credentials instead of using long-term access keys. For
            more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary
               security credentials in IAM</a>.</p>

      When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies 
      grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers 
      another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To 
      see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awscloudtrail.html">Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS CloudTrail</a> in the 
      <em>Service Authorization Reference</em>.

      A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. 
      Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, 
      but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles. 
 </p>
  
         
         
         
         <p>CloudTrail supports a service-linked role for integration with AWS Organizations. This
            role is required for the creation of an organization trail or event data store.
            Organization trails and event data stores log events for all AWS accounts in an
            organization. For more information about creating or managing CloudTrail
            service-linked roles, see <a href="./using-service-linked-roles.html">Using service-linked roles for AWS CloudTrail</a>.</p>
