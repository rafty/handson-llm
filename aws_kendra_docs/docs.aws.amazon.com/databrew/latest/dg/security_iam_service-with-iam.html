               identity-based policies</h2>
         <p>With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and
            resources, and also the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied.
            DataBrew supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn
            about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html">IAM JSON Policy Elements
               Reference</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
          
            <h3 id="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions">Actions</h3>
            <p>Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is,
               an AWS JSON policy can specify which principal can perform actions on what resources, 
               and under what conditions.</p>
            <p>The Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions to which you can allow or 
               deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS 
               API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have 
               a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in 
               a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.</p>
             <p>Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.</p>
            <p>Policy actions in DataBrew use the following prefix before the action:
                  <code class="code">databrew:</code>. For example, to grant someone permission to run
               an Amazon EC2 instance with the Amazon EC2 <code class="code">RunInstances</code> API operation, you include
               the <code class="code">ec2:RunInstances</code> action in their policy. Policy statements must
               include either an <code class="code">Action</code> or <code class="code">NotAction</code> element.
               DataBrew defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can
               perform with it.</p>
            <p>To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as
               follows.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight">"Action": [
      "databrew:<em>CreateRecipeJob</em>",
      "databrew:<em>UpdateSchedule</em>"</code></pre>
            <p>You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (*). For example, to specify all
               actions that begin with the word <code class="code">Describe</code>, include the following
               action.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight"><code class="code" copy="true">"Action": "databrew:Describe*"</code></code></pre>
            <p>To see a list of DataBrew actions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_databrew.html#databrew-actions-as-permissions">Actions Defined by AWS Glue DataBrew</a> in the
                  <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
          
          
            <h3 id="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources">Resources</h3>
            
   
            
   
      <p>Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which <b>principal</b> can perform 
         <b>actions</b> on what <b>resources</b>, and under what <b>conditions</b>.</p>
  
            <p>The <code class="code">Resource</code> JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a
                  <code class="code">Resource</code> or a <code class="code">NotResource</code> element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Name (ARN)</a>. You can do this for actions that support a 
                  specific resource type, known as <em>resource-level permissions</em>.</p>
            <p>For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations,
                  use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.</p>
         <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="">"Resource": "*"</code></pre>

            <p>For example, to specify the <code class="code">i-1234567890abcdef0</code> instance in your
               statement, use the following ARN.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="">"Resource": "arn:aws:databrew:us-east-1:123456789012:dataset/my-chess-dataset"</code></pre>
            <p>To specify all instances that belong to a specific account, use the wildcard

            <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="">"Resource": "arn:aws:databrew:us-east-1:123456789012:dataset/*"</code></pre>
            <p>You can't perform some DataBrew actions, such as those for creating
               resources, on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard
               (*).</p>

               of roles to choose from. Make sure to choose a role that allows read access to an
               Amazon S3 bucket or AWS Glue Data Catalog resource, as appropriate.
