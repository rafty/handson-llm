      <em>incidents</em> affecting your applications hosted on AWS. </p><p>In the context of AWS, an incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in the
    quality of services that can have a significant impact on business operations. Therefore, it’s
    crucial for organizations to establish a response strategy to efficiently mitigate and recover
    from incidents, and implement actions to prevent future incidents.</p><p>Incident Manager helps reduce the time to resolve incidents by:</p><div class="itemizedlist">

    </li></ul></div><p>The features and workflows built into Incident Manager are based on the best practices for
    incident response that Amazon has been developing almost since its inception. Incident Manager
    integrates with such AWS services as Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Systems Manager, and Amazon EventBridge.</p>

        <dt><span class="term"><b>Response plan </b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A response plan functions as a template that defines what must be in place when an
            incident occurs. It includes such information as:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">

        </dd>
       
        <dt><span class="term"><b>Incident detection</b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>You can configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms and Amazon EventBridge events to create incidents when
            conditions or changes that affect your AWS resources are detected. </p>
        </dd>
       
        <dt><span class="term"><b>Runbook automation support</b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>You can initiate Automation runbooks from within Incident Manager to automate your
            critical response to incidents and provide detailed steps to first responders. </p>
        </dd>
       
        <dt><span class="term"><b>Engagement and escalation</b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>An <em>engagement plan</em> specifies everyone to notify
            for each unique incident. You can specify individual contacts that you have added to
            Incident Manager or specify an on-call schedule that you created in Incident Manager. Engagement
            plans also specify an escalation path to help ensure visibility among stakeholders and
            active participation during the incident response process.</p>
        </dd>
       
        <dt><span class="term"><b>On-call schedules</b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>An <em>on-call schedule</em> in Incident Manager consists of
            one or more rotations that you create for the schedule. For each rotation, you can
            include up to 30 contacts. When added to an escalation plan or response plan, the
            on-call schedule defines who is notified when an incident occurs that requires responder
            intervention. On-call schedules help ensure that you have full, redundant, 24/7 coverage
            as needed for your incident response.</p>
        </dd>
       
        <dt><span class="term"><b>Active collaboration</b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Incident responders actively respond to incidents through integration with the
            AWS Chatbot client. AWS Chatbot supports creating chat channels for Incident Manager that use
              Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Amazon Chime. Responders can
            communicate directly with one another, receive automated notifications about incidents,
            and—in Slack and Microsoft Teams—directly
            run some Incident Manager command line interface (CLI) operations.</p>
        </dd>
       
        <dt><span class="term"><b>Incident diagnosis</b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Responders can view up-to-date information in the Incident Manager console during an
            incident. Based on the changes in information, responders can then create follow-up
            items and remediate them by using Automation runbooks.</p>
        </dd>
       
        <dt><span class="term"><b>Post-incident analysis</b></span></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>After an incident is resolved, you use a post-incident analysis to identify
            improvements to your incident response, including time to detection and mitigation. An
            analysis can also help you understand the root cause of the incidents. Incident Manager
            creates recommended follow-up action items that you can use to improve your incident
            response.</p>

    <h2 id="benefits">Benefits of using Incident Manager</h2>
     
      <h6>Align
        quickly</h6>
      <p>Learn about the benefits of using Incident Manager in your incident detection and response
        operations.</p>
     
    <p>This section describes the advantages that your organization can gain when you implement
      an Incident Manager response plan.</p>
     
      <h6>Diagnose issues efficiently and immediately</h6>
      <p>Amazon CloudWatch alarms and Amazon EventBridge events that you configure can create incidents
        automatically when there is any unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of your
        services. </p>
     
    <p>CloudWatch alarms detect and report when there are changes to the value of the metric or
      expression that is relative to a threshold over a number of time periods. EventBridge events are
      created as the result of change in an environment, application, or service that you have
      specified in an EventBridge rule. When you create an alarm or event, you can specify an action for an
      incident to be created in Incident Manager and the appropriate response plan to facilitate the
      engagement, escalation, and mitigation of the incident.</p>
    <p>Incident Manager provides the ability to automatically collect and track the metrics related to
      an incident, through the use of CloudWatch metrics. In addition to the automated metrics generated
      for the incident when it is created through a CloudWatch alarm, you can add metrics manually in real
      time, to provide additional context and data to the responders in an incident.</p>
    <p>Use the Incident Manager incident timeline to display points of interest in chronological
      order. Responders can also use the timeline to add custom events to describe what they did or
      what happened. Automated points of interest include:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>A CloudWatch alarm or EventBridge rule creates an incident.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Incident metrics are reported to Incident Manager.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Responders are engaged.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Runbook steps complete successfully.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
     
      <h6>Engage effectively</h6>
      <p>Incident Manager brings incident responders together through the use of contacts, on-call
        schedules, escalation plans, and chat channels. You define individual contacts directly in
        Incident Manager and specify contact preferences (email, SMS, or voice). You add contacts to
        on-call schedule rotations to determine who is engaged to deal with incidents during a given
        period. Using your defined contacts and on-call schedules, you create escalation plans to
        engage the necessary responders at the right time during an incident. </p>
     
     
      <h6>Collaborate in real time</h6>
      <p>Communication during an incident is the key to faster resolution. Using an AWS Chatbot
        client set up to use Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Amazon Chime, you can
        bring together responders in their preferred connected chat channel where they directly
        interact with the incident and with one another. Incident Manager also displays the real-time
        actions of incident responders in the chat channel, providing context to others.</p>
     
     
      <h6>Automate service restoration</h6>
      <p>Incident Manager enables your responders to focus on the key tasks required to resolve an
        incident through the use of Automation <em>runbooks</em>. In
        Incident Manager, runbooks are a predefined series of actions taken to resolve an incident. They
        combine the power of automated tasks with manual steps as needed, leaving responders more
        available to analyze and respond to impact.</p>
     
     
      <h6>Prevent future incidents</h6>
      <p>Using Incident Manager post incident analysis, your team can develop more robust response
        plans and effect change across your applications to prevent future incidents and downtime.
        Post-incident analysis also provides for iterative learning and improvement of runbooks,
        response plans, and metrics.</p>
