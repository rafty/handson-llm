               actions</em> that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. 
               These additional actions are called <em>dependent actions</em>.</p>

         <p>Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resource-based policies are 
         IAM <em>role trust policies</em> and Amazon S3 <em>bucket policies</em>. In services that support resource-based policies, service 
         administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions
            a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">specify a principal</a> in a resource-based policy. Principals 
            can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.</p>
  
         <p>To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities
            in another account as the principal in a
               resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account principal to a resource-based
            policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship. When the principal and the
            resource are in different AWS accounts, an IAM administrator in the trusted account 
            must also grant the principal entity (user or role) permission to access the resource. They grant 
            permission by attaching an identity-based policy to the entity. However, if a resource-based 
            policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is 
            required. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How
               IAM roles differ from resource-based policies </a>in the

      <p>Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which <b>principal</b> can perform 
         <b>actions</b> on what <b>resources</b>, and under what <b>conditions</b>.</p>
  
            <p>The <code class="code">Action</code> element of a JSON policy describes the
               actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy
               actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as <em>permission-only 
               actions</em> that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. 
               These additional actions are called <em>dependent actions</em>.</p>
            <p>Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.</p>
  
            
            
            <p>Policy actions in AWS WA Tool use the following prefix before the action:
                        <code class="code">wellarchitected:</code>. For example, to allow an entity to define
                    a workload, an administrator must attach a policy that allows
                        <code class="code">wellarchitected:CreateWorkload</code> actions. Similarly, to prevent
                    an entity from deleting workloads, an administrator can attach a policy that
                    denies <code class="code">wellarchitected:DeleteWorkload</code> actions.  Policy statements
                    must include either an <code class="code">Action</code> or <code class="code">NotAction</code> element.
                    AWS WA Tool defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can
                    perform with this service.</p>

            <p>The <code class="code">Resource</code> JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a

As a best practice, specify a resource using its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Name (ARN)</a>. You can do this for actions that support a 
                  specific resource type, known as <em>resource-level permissions</em>.</p>
            <p>For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations,
                  use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.</p>

      <p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions
      based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are called <em>tags</em>. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users
      or roles) and to many AWS resources. Tagging entities and resources is the first step of ABAC. Then you 
      design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the resource that they 
      are trying to access.</p>
      <p>ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly and helps with situations where policy management becomes cumbersome.</p>
      <p>To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html">condition
         element</a> of a policy using the
         <code class="code">aws:ResourceTag/<code class="replaceable">key-name</code></code>,
         <code class="code">aws:RequestTag/<code class="replaceable">key-name</code></code>, or
         <code class="code">aws:TagKeys</code> condition keys.</p>
           <p>If a service supports all three condition keys for every resource type, then the value is <b>Yes</b> for the service. 
  If a service supports all three condition keys for only some resource types, then the value is <b>Partial</b>.</p>
  <p>For more information about ABAC, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html">What is ABAC?</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>. To view a tutorial with steps for setting up ABAC, see

         <p>You are using temporary credentials if you sign in to the AWS Management Console using any method

            You also automatically create temporary credentials when you sign in to the console as a user and

         <p>You can manually create temporary credentials using the AWS CLI or AWS API. You can

      When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies 
      grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers 
      another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To 
      see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awswell-architectedtool.html">Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Well-Architected Tool</a> in the

      A service role is an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> that a service assumes to perform 
      actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For 
      more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html">Creating a role to delegate permissions 
      to an AWS service</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

      A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. 
      Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, 
      but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

            that work with IAM</a>. Find a service in the table that includes a
