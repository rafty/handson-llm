         <p>Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These
            policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based
            policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html">Creating IAM policies</a> in the
            <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
  
         <p>With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and
            resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied.  You
            can't specify the principal in an identity-based policy because it applies to the user
            or role to which it is attached. To learn about all of the elements that you can use in a
            JSON policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html">IAM JSON

         <p>Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resource-based policies are 
         IAM <em>role trust policies</em> and Amazon S3 <em>bucket policies</em>. In services that support resource-based policies, service 
         administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions
            a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">specify a principal</a> in a resource-based policy. Principals 
            can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.</p>
  
         <p>To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities
            in another account as the principal in a
               resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account principal to a resource-based
            policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship. When the principal and the
            resource are in different AWS accounts, an IAM administrator in the trusted account 
            must also grant the principal entity (user or role) permission to access the resource. They grant 
            permission by attaching an identity-based policy to the entity. However, if a resource-based 
            policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is

            <p>The <code class="code">Condition</code> element (or <code class="code">Condition</code>
               <em>block</em>) lets you specify conditions in which a
               statement is in effect. The <code class="code">Condition</code> element is optional. You can create
               conditional expressions that use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html">condition
                  operators</a>, such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the

            <p>If you specify multiple <code class="code">Condition</code> elements in a statement, or
               multiple keys in a single <code class="code">Condition</code> element, AWS evaluates them using
               a logical <code class="code">AND</code> operation. If you specify multiple values for a single
               condition key, AWS evaluates the condition using a logical <code class="code">OR</code>
               operation. All of the conditions must be met before the statement's permissions are
               granted.</p>
            <p> You can also use placeholder variables when you specify conditions. For example,
               you can grant an IAM user permission to access a resource only if it is tagged with

      <p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions
      based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are called <em>tags</em>. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users
      or roles) and to many AWS resources. Tagging entities and resources is the first step of ABAC. Then you 
      design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the resource that they 
      are trying to access.</p>
      <p>ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly and helps with situations where policy management becomes cumbersome.</p>
      <p>To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html">condition
         element</a> of a policy using the
         <code class="code">aws:ResourceTag/<code class="replaceable">key-name</code></code>,
         <code class="code">aws:RequestTag/<code class="replaceable">key-name</code></code>, or
         <code class="code">aws:TagKeys</code> condition keys.</p>
           <p>If a service supports all three condition keys for every resource type, then the value is <b>Yes</b> for the service. 
  If a service supports all three condition keys for only some resource types, then the value is <b>Partial</b>.</p>

      When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies 
      grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers 
      another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To

      A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. 
      Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, 
      but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

         grant cross-account permissions to another AWS account (for example, account B)
         or an AWS service as follows:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
          
          
          
      <ol><li>
            <p>Account A administrator creates an IAM role and attaches a
               permissions policy to the role that grants permissions on resources in
               account A.</p>
         </li><li>
            <p>Account A administrator attaches a trust policy to the role
               identifying account B as the principal who can assume the role. </p>
         </li><li>
            <p>Account B administrator can then delegate permissions to assume the
               role to any users in account B. Doing this allows users in account B to
               create or access resources in account A. The principal in the trust
               policy can also be an AWS service principal if you want to grant an AWS
               service permissions to assume the role.</p>
         </li></ol></div>
      <p>For more information about using IAM to delegate permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html">Access Management</a> in the
         <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
      
      <p>The following is an example policy that grants permissions to put and get lexicons as
         well as to list those lexicons currently available.</p>
      <p>Amazon Polly supports Identity-based policies for actions at the resource-level. In some
         cases, the resource can be limited by an ARN. This is true for the <code class="code">SynthesizeSpeech</code>, 
         <code class="code">StartSpeechSynthesisTask</code>, <code class="code">PutLexicon</code>, <code class="code">GetLexicon</code>, and <code class="code">DeleteLexicon</code> operations.
         In these cases, the <code class="code">Resource</code> value is indicated by the ARN. For example:
         <code class="code">arn:aws:polly:<code class="replaceable">us-east-2</code>:<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:lexicon/*</code>
         as the <code class="code">Resource</code> value specifies permissions on all owned lexicons within the
         <code class="code">us-east-2</code> Region.</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="nohighlight"><span>{</span>
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [<span>{</span>
      "Sid": "AllowPut-Get-ListActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "polly:PutLexicon",
         "polly:GetLexicon",
         "polly:ListLexicons"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:polly:<code class="replaceable">us-east-2</code>:<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:lexicon/*"
      }
   ]
}</code></pre>
      <p>However, not all operations use ARNs. This is the case with the <code class="code">DescribeVoices</code>, <code class="code">ListLexicons</code>, 
         <code class="code">GetSpeechSynthesisTasks</code>, and <code class="code">ListSpeechSynthesisTasks</code> operations.</p>
