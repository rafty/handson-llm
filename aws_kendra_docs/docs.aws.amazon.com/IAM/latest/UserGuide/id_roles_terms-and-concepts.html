        <p>An IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.
          An IAM role has some similarities to an IAM user. Roles and users are both AWS
          identities with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in
          AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended
          to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term
          credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume
          a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.</p>
        <p>Roles can be used by the following:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">

      A service role is an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> that a service assumes to perform

        <p>A special type of service role that an application running on an Amazon EC2 instance can

          it is launched. Applications running on that instance can retrieve temporary security
          credentials and perform actions that the role allows. For details about using a service

      A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. 
      Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, 
      but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

            you might receive an email announcing a new role in your account. In this case, the

            take any action to support this role, and you should not manually delete it. For more

      <dd>
        <p>Role chaining is when you use a role to assume a second role through the AWS CLI or API. 
          For example, <code class="code">RoleA</code> has permission to assume <code class="code">RoleB</code>. 
          You can enable User1 to assume <code class="code">RoleA</code> by using their long-term user credentials in 
          the AssumeRole API operation. This returns <code class="code">RoleA</code> short-term credentials. 
          With role chaining, you can use <code class="code">RoleA</code>'s short-term credentials to enable User1 to assume <code class="code">RoleB</code>.</p>  
        <p>When you assume a role, you can pass a session tag and set the tag as transitive.
          Transitive session tags are passed to all subsequent sessions in a role chain. To learn
          more about session tags, see <a href="./id_session-tags.html">Passing session tags in AWS STS</a>.</p>
        <p>Role chaining limits your AWS CLI or AWS API role session to a maximum of one hour.
          When you use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html">AssumeRole</a> API
          operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the
            <code class="code">DurationSeconds</code> parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200
          seconds (12 hours), depending on the <a href="./id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">maximum session duration setting</a> for your role. However, if you assume a role
          using role chaining and provide a <code class="code">DurationSeconds</code> parameter value greater
          than one hour, the operation fails.</p>
        <p>AWS does not treat using roles to <a href="./id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">grant
            permissions to applications that run on EC2 instances</a> as role chaining.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>The granting of permissions to someone to allow access to resources that you control.
          Delegation involves setting up a trust between two accounts. The first is the account that
          owns the resource (the trusting account). The second is the account that contains the
          users that need to access the resource (the trusted account). The trusted and trusting
          accounts can be any of the following:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
           
           
           
        <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
            <p>The same account.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Separate accounts that are both under your organization's control.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Two accounts owned by different organizations.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
        <p>To delegate permission to access a resource, you <a href="./id_roles_create_for-user.html">create an IAM role</a> in the trusting account
          that has two <a href="#term_policy">policies</a> attached. The <em>permissions policy</em> grants the user of the role the needed
          permissions to carry out the intended tasks on the resource. The <em>trust policy</em> specifies which trusted account members are allowed to assume
          the role.</p>
        <p>When you create a trust policy, you cannot specify a wildcard (*) as a principal. The
          trust policy is attached to the role in the trusting account, and is one-half of the
          permissions. The other half is a permissions policy attached to the user in the trusted
          account that <a href="./id_roles_use_permissions-to-switch.html">allows that user to switch
            to, or assume the role</a>. A user who assumes a role temporarily gives up his or her
          own permissions and instead takes on the permissions of the role. When the user exits, or
          stops using the role, the original user permissions are restored. An additional parameter
          called <a href="./id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html">external ID</a> helps ensure
          secure use of roles between accounts that are not controlled by the same
          organization.</p>

            Amazon</b>, <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Google</b>, or any IdP that is compatible with <b>OpenID

          is compatible with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, such as Microsoft Active
          Directory Federation Services. When you use OIDC and SAML 2.0 to configure a trust
          relationship between these external identity providers and AWS, the user is assigned to
          an IAM role. The user also receives temporary credentials that allow the user to access

      <dd>
        <p>A role that grants access to resources in one account to a trusted principal in a
          different account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, some
          AWS services allow you to attach a policy directly to a resource (instead of using a
          role as a proxy). These are called resource-based policies, and you can use them to grant
          principals in another AWS account access to the resource. Some of these resources
          include Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, S3 Glacier vaults, Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics, and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
          queues. To learn which services support resource-based policies, see <a href="./reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">AWS services that work with
      IAM</a>. For more information about
          resource-based policies, see <a href="./id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How IAM roles differ from resource-based
      policies</a>.</p>
