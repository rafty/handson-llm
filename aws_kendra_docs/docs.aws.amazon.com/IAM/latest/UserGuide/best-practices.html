      <h2 id="bp-users-federation-idp">Require human users to use federation with an
          identity provider to access AWS using temporary credentials</h2>
      <p>Human users, also known as <em>human identities,</em> are the people,
        administrators, developers, operators, and consumers of your applications. They must have an
        identity to access your AWS environments and applications. Human users that are members of
        your organization are also known as <em>workforce identities.</em> Human users
        can also be external users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS
        resources. They can do this via a web browser, client application, mobile app, or
        interactive command-line tools.</p>
      <p>Require your human users to use temporary credentials when accessing AWS. You can use
        an identity provider for your human users to provide federated access to AWS accounts by
        assuming roles, which provide temporary credentials. For centralized access management, we
        recommend that you use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)
          (IAM Identity Center)</a> to manage access to your accounts and permissions within those accounts.
        You can manage your user identities with IAM Identity Center, or manage access permissions for user
        identities in IAM Identity Center from an external identity provider. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is
          AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)</a> in the <em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em>.</p>
      <p>For more information about roles, see <a href="./id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html">Roles terms and concepts</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="bp-workloads-use-roles">Require workloads to use temporary credentials with
          IAM roles to access AWS</h2>
      <p>A <em>workload</em> is a collection of resources and code that delivers
        business value, such as an application or backend process. Your workload can have
        applications, operational tools, and components that require an identity to make requests to
        AWS services, such as requests to read data. These identities include machines running in
        your AWS environments, such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions.</p>
      <p>You can also manage <em>machine identities</em> for external parties who
        need access. To give access to machine identities, you can use IAM roles. IAM roles have
        specific permissions and provide a way to access AWS by relying on temporary security
        credentials with a role session. Additionally, you might have machines outside of AWS that
        need access to your AWS environments. For machines that run outside of AWS you can use
          <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html">AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere</a>. For more information about roles, see <a href="./id_roles.html">IAM roles</a>. For details about how to use roles to
        delegate access across AWS accounts, see <a href="./tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html">IAM tutorial: Delegate access across AWS
         accounts using IAM roles</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="enable-mfa-for-privileged-users">Require multi-factor authentication
          (MFA)</h2>
      
      <p>We recommend using IAM roles for human users and workloads that access your AWS
        resources so that they use temporary credentials. However, for scenarios in which you need
        an IAM user or root user in your account, require MFA for additional security. With MFA,
        users have a device that generates a response to an authentication challenge. Each user's
        credentials and device-generated response are required to complete the sign-in process. For
        more information, see <a href="./id_credentials_mfa.html">Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS</a>.</p>
      <p>If you use IAM Identity Center for centralized access management for human users, you can use the
        IAM Identity Center MFA capabilities when your identity source is configured with the IAM Identity Center identity
        store, AWS Managed Microsoft AD, or AD Connector. For more information about MFA in IAM Identity Center
        see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html">
          Multi-factor authentication</a> in the <em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="rotate-credentials">Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require
          long-term credentials</h2>
      <p>Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating
        long-term credentials such as access keys. However, for scenarios in which you need IAM
        users with programmatic access and long-term credentials, we recommend that you rotate
        access keys. Regularly rotating long-term credentials helps you familiarize yourself with
        the process. This is useful in case you are ever in a situation where you must rotate
        credentials, such as when an employee leaves your company. We recommend that you use
          <em>IAM access last used information</em> to rotate and remove access keys
        safely. For more information, see <a href="./id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_RotateAccessKey">Rotating access keys</a>.</p>
      <p>There are specific use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users in
        AWS. Some of the use cases include the following:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="topcom">Workloads that cannot use IAM roles</span> – You
            might run a workload from a location that needs to access AWS. In some situations, you
            can't use IAM roles to provide temporary credentials, such as for WordPress plugins.
            In these situations, use IAM user long-term access keys for that workload to
            authenticate to AWS.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="topcom">Third-party AWS clients</span> – If you are using
            tools that don’t support access with IAM Identity Center, such as third-party AWS clients or vendors
            that are not hosted on AWS, use IAM user long-term access keys.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><span class="topcom">AWS CodeCommit access</span> – If you are using CodeCommit to
            store your code, you can use an IAM user with either SSH keys or service-specific
            credentials for CodeCommit to authenticate to your repositories. We recommend that you do
            this in addition to using a user in IAM Identity Center for normal authentication. Users in IAM Identity Center are
            the people in your workforce who need access to your AWS accounts or to your cloud
            applications. To give users access to your CodeCommit repositories without configuring IAM
            users, you can configure the <b>git-remote-codecommit</b> utility. For more
            information about IAM and CodeCommit, see <a href="./id_credentials_ssh-keys.html">Using IAM with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and
      AWS access keys</a>. For more information about configuring the

            authenticate with Amazon Keyspaces. Users in IAM Identity Center are the people in your workforce who need access
            to your AWS accounts or to your cloud applications. You can also connect to Amazon Keyspaces
            using temporary credentials. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/access.credentials.html#temporary.credentials.IAM">Using temporary credentials to connect to Amazon Keyspaces using an IAM role and the SigV4

      <h2 id="lock-away-credentials">Safeguard your root user credentials and don't use them
          for everyday tasks</h2>
      <p>When you create an AWS account you establish a root user name and password to sign in to
        the AWS Management Console. Safeguard your root user credentials the same way you would protect other
        sensitive personal information. You can do this by configuring MFA for your root user
        credentials. We don't recommend generating access keys for your root user, because they allow
        full access to all your resources for all AWS services, including your billing
        information. Don’t use your root user for everyday tasks. Use the root user to complete the tasks
        that only the root user can perform. 
  For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">Tasks that require root user credentials</a> in the 
 <em>AWS Account Management Reference Guide</em>.
  </p>
      <p>For additional best practices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.html">Best practices to protect
          your account's root user</a> in the <em>AWS Account Management User Guide</em>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="grant-least-privilege">Apply least-privilege permissions</h2>
      <p>When you set permissions with IAM policies, grant only the permissions required to
        perform a task. You do this by defining the actions that can be taken on specific resources
        under specific conditions, also known as <em>least-privilege permissions</em>.
        You might start with broad permissions while you explore the permissions that are required
        for your workload or use case. As your use case matures, you can work to reduce the
        permissions that you grant to work toward least privilege. For more information about using
        IAM to apply permissions, see <a href="./access_policies.html">Policies and permissions in IAM</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="bp-use-aws-defined-policies">Get started with AWS managed policies and
          move toward least-privilege permissions</h2>
      <p>To get started granting permissions to your users and workloads, use the <em>AWS
          managed policies</em> that grant permissions for many common use cases. They are
        available in your AWS account. Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant
        least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because they are available for use
        by all AWS customers. As a result, we recommend that you reduce permissions further by
        defining <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies">customer managed policies</a> that are specific to your use cases. For more
        information, see <a href="./access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies">AWS managed policies</a>. For more information about AWS managed policies that are designed for specific job
        functions, see <a href="./access_policies_job-functions.html">AWS managed policies for job functions</a>.</p>

      <p>To grant only the permissions required to perform a task, you can generate policies
        based on your access activity that is logged in AWS CloudTrail. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">IAM Access Analyzer</a> analyzes the
        services and actions that your IAM roles use, and then generates a fine-grained policy
        that you can use. After you test each generated policy, you can deploy the policy to your
        production environment. This ensures that you grant only the required permissions to your
        workloads. For more information about policy generation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html">IAM Access Analyzer policy
          generation</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="remove-credentials">Regularly review and remove unused users, roles,
          permissions, policies, and credentials</h2>
      <p>You might have IAM users, roles, permissions, policies, or credentials that you no
        longer need in your AWS account. IAM provides <em>last accessed
          information</em> to help you identify the users, roles, permissions, policies, and
        credentials that you no longer need so that you can remove them. This helps you reduce the
        number of users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials that you have to monitor. You
        can also use this information to refine your IAM policies to better adhere to
        least-privilege permissions. For more information, see <a href="./access_policies_access-advisor.html">Refining permissions in AWS using last
         accessed information</a>.
      </p>
     
      <h2 id="use-policy-conditions">Use conditions in IAM policies to further restrict
          access</h2>
      <p>You can specify conditions under which a policy statement is in effect. That way, you
        can grant access to actions and resources, but only if the access request meets specific
        conditions. For example, you can write a policy condition to specify that all requests must
        be sent using SSL. You can also use conditions to grant access to service actions, but only
        if they are used through a specific AWS service, such as AWS CloudFormation. For more information, see
          <a href="./reference_policies_elements_condition.html">IAM JSON policy elements:
        Condition</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="bp-preview-access">Verify public and cross-account access to resources with
          IAM Access Analyzer</h2>
      <p>Before you grant permissions for public or cross-account access in AWS, we recommend
        that you verify if such access is required. You can use IAM Access Analyzer to help you preview
        and analyze public and cross-account access for supported resource types. You do this by
        reviewing the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-findings.html">findings</a> that
        IAM Access Analyzer generates. These findings help you verify that your resource access controls
        grant the access that you expect. Additionally, as you update public and cross-account
        permissions, you can verify the effect of your changes before deploying new access controls
        to your resources. IAM Access Analyzer also monitors supported resource types continuously and
        generates a finding for resources that allow public or cross-account access. For more
        information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-preview-access-apis.html">Previewing access with
          IAM Access Analyzer APIs</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="best-practice-policy-validation">Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate your IAM
          policies to ensure secure and functional permissions</h2>
      <p>Validate the policies you create to ensure that they adhere to the <a href="./access_policies.html#access_policies-json">IAM policy language</a> (JSON) and IAM best
        practices. You can validate your policies by using IAM Access Analyzer policy validation.
        IAM Access Analyzer provides more than 100 policy checks and actionable recommendations to help
        you author secure and functional policies. As you author new policies or edit existing
        policies in the console, IAM Access Analyzer provides recommendations to help you refine and
        validate your policies before you save them. Additionally, we recommend that you review and
        validate all of your existing policies. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-validation.html">IAM Access Analyzer policy validation</a>. For more information about policy checks
        provided by IAM Access Analyzer, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks.html">IAM Access Analyzer policy
          check reference</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="bp-permissions-guardrails">Establish permissions guardrails across multiple
          accounts</h2>
      <p>As you scale your workloads, separate them by using multiple accounts that are managed
        with AWS Organizations. We recommend that you use Organizations <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html">service control
          policies</a> (SCPs) to establish permissions guardrails to control access for all
        IAM users and roles across your accounts. SCPs are a type of organization policy that you
        can use to manage permissions in your organization at the AWS organization, OU, or account
        level. The permissions guardrails that you establish apply to all users and roles within the
        covered accounts. However, SCPs alone are insufficient to grant permissions to the accounts
        in your organization. To do this, your administrator must attach <a href="./access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html">identity-based or resource-based
          policies</a> to IAM users, IAM roles, or the resources in your accounts. For more
        information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/organizations.html">AWS Organizations, accounts, and IAM guardrails</a>.</p>
     
      <h2 id="bp-permissions-boundaries">Use permissions boundaries to delegate
          permissions management within an account</h2>
      <p>In some scenarios, you might want to delegate permissions management within an account
        to others. For example, you could allow developers to create and manage roles for their
        workloads. When you delegate permissions to others, use <em>permissions
          boundaries</em> to set the maximum permissions that you delegate. A permissions
        boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions
        that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM role. A permissions boundary does not
        grant permissions on its own. For more information, see <a href="./access_policies_boundaries.html">Permissions boundaries for IAM
            entities</a>.</p>
