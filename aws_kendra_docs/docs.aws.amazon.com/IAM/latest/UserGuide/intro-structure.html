    your AWS account. The IAM infrastructure is illustrated by the following diagram:</p><div class="mediaobject">
     
      <img src="/images/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/intro-diagram _policies_800.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;      IntroToIAM_Diagram&#xA;    " />
     
     
  </div><p>First, a human user or an application uses their sign-in credentials to authenticate with
    AWS. Authentication is provided by matching the sign-in credentials to a principal (an
    IAM user, federated user, IAM role, or application) trusted by the AWS account. </p><p>Next, a request is made to grant the principal access to resources. Access is granted in
    response to an authorization request. For example, when you first sign in to the console and are
    on the console Home page, you are not accessing a specific service. When you select a service,
    the request for authorization is sent to that service and it looks to see if your identity is on
    the list of authorized users, what policies are being enforced to control the level of access
    granted, and any other policies that might be in effect. Authorization requests can be made by
    principals within your AWS account or from another AWS account that you trust.</p><p>Once authorized, the principal can take action or perform operations on resources in your
    AWS account. For example, the principal could launch a new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance, modify
    IAM group membership, or delete Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets.</p><div class="highlights" id="inline-topiclist"><h6>Basic concepts</h6><ul><li><a href="#intro-structure-terms">Terms</a></li><li><a href="#intro-structure-principal">Principal</a></li><li><a href="#intro-structure-request">Request</a></li><li><a href="#intro-structure-authentication">Authentication</a></li><li><a href="#intro-structure-authorization">Authorization</a></li><li><a href="#intro-structure-actions">Actions or operations</a></li><li><a href="#intro-structure-resources">Resources</a></li></ul></div>
    <h2 id="intro-structure-terms">Terms</h2>
    <p>In the previous illustration we used specific terminology to describe how to obtain access
      to resources. These IAM terms are commonly used when working with AWS:</p>

      </dl></div>
   
    <h2 id="intro-structure-principal">Principal</h2>
    <p>A <em>principal</em> is a human user or workload that can make a
      request for an action or operation on an AWS resource. After authentication, the principal
      can be granted either permanent or temporary credentials to make requests to AWS, depending
      on the principal type. IAM users and root user are granted permanent credentials, while roles
      are granted temporary credentials. As a <a href="./best-practices.html">best practice</a>,
      we recommend that you require human users and workloads to access AWS resources using
      temporary credentials.</p>
   
    <h2 id="intro-structure-request">Request</h2>
    <p>When a principal tries to use the AWS Management Console, the AWS API, or the AWS CLI, that principal
      sends a <em>request</em> to AWS. The request includes the following
      information:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
       
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Actions or operations</b> – The actions or
          operations that the principal wants to perform. This can be an action in the AWS Management Console, or
          an operation in the AWS CLI or AWS API.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Resources</b> – The AWS resource object upon
          which the actions or operations are performed.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Principal</b> – The person or application that
          used an entity (user or role) to send the request. Information about the principal
          includes the policies that are associated with the entity that the principal used to sign
          in. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Environment data</b> – Information about the IP
          address, user agent, SSL enabled status, or the time of day.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Resource data</b> – Data related to the resource
          that is being requested. This can include information such as a DynamoDB table name or a tag
          on an Amazon EC2 instance.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>AWS gathers the request information into a <em>request context</em>, which
      is used to evaluate and authorize the request.</p>
   
    <h2 id="intro-structure-authentication">Authentication</h2>
    <p>A principal must be authenticated (signed in to AWS) using their credentials to send a
      request to AWS. Some services, such as Amazon S3 and AWS STS, allow a few requests from anonymous
      users. However, they are the exception to the rule.</p>
    <p>To authenticate from the console as a root user, you must sign in with your email address and
      password. As a federated user, you are authenticated by your identity provider and granted
      access to AWS resources by assuming IAM roles. As an IAM user, provide your account ID
      or alias, and then your user name and password. To authenticate workloads from the API or
      AWS CLI, you might use temporary credentials through being assigned a role or you might use
      long-term credentials by providing your access key and secret key. You might also be required
      to provide additional security information. As a best practice, AWS recommends that you use
      multi-factor authentication (MFA) and temporary credentials to increase the security of your
      account. To learn more about the IAM entities that AWS can authenticate, see <a href="./id_users.html">IAM users</a> and <a href="./id_roles.html">IAM roles</a>.</p>
   
    <h2 id="intro-structure-authorization">Authorization</h2>
    <p>You must also be authorized (allowed) to complete your request. During authorization,
      AWS uses values from the request context to check for policies that apply to the request. It
      then uses the policies to determine whether to allow or deny the request. Most policies are
      stored in AWS as <a href="./access_policies.html#access_policies-json">JSON documents</a> and specify the
      permissions for principal entities. There are <a href="./access_policies.html">several types of
        policies</a> that can affect whether a request is authorized. To provide your users with
      permissions to access the AWS resources in their own account, you need only identity-based
      policies. Resource-based policies are popular for granting <a href="./access_permissions-required.html#UserPermissionsAcrossAccounts">cross-account access</a>. The other policy types
      are advanced features and should be used carefully.</p>
    <p>AWS checks each policy that applies to the context of your request. If a single
      permissions policy includes a denied action, AWS denies the entire request and stops
      evaluating. This is called an <em>explicit deny</em>. Because requests are
        <em>denied by default</em>, AWS authorizes your request only if every part of
      your request is allowed by the applicable permissions policies. The evaluation logic for a
      request within a single account follows these general rules:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p>By default, all requests are denied. (In general, requests made using the AWS account root user
          credentials for resources in the account are always allowed.) </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>An explicit allow in any permissions policy (identity-based or resource-based)
          overrides this default.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>The existence of an Organizations SCP, IAM permissions boundary, or a session policy
          overrides the allow. If one or more of these policy types exists, they must all allow the
          request. Otherwise, it is implicitly denied.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>An explicit deny in any policy overrides any allows.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>To learn more about how all types of policies are evaluated, see <a href="./reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html">Policy evaluation logic</a>. If you need to make a request in a
      different account, a policy in the other account must allow you to access the resource
        <em>and</em> the IAM entity that you use to make the request
      must have an identity-based policy that allows the request.</p>
   
    <h2 id="intro-structure-actions">Actions or operations</h2>
    <p>After your request has been authenticated and authorized, AWS approves the actions or
      operations in your request. Operations are defined by a service, and include things that you
      can do to a resource, such as viewing, creating, editing, and deleting that resource. For
      example, IAM supports approximately 40 actions for a user resource, including the following
      actions:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p><code class="code">CreateUser</code></p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><code class="code">DeleteUser</code></p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><code class="code">GetUser</code></p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><code class="code">UpdateUser</code></p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>To allow a principal to perform an operation, you must include the necessary actions in a
      policy that applies to the principal or the affected resource. To see a list of actions,
      resource types, and condition keys supported by each service, see <a href="reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Actions, Resources, and
        Condition Keys for AWS Services</a>.</p>
   
    <h2 id="intro-structure-resources">Resources</h2>
    <p>After AWS approves the operations in your request, they can be performed on the related
      resources within your account. A resource is an object that exists within a service. Examples
      include an Amazon EC2 instance, an IAM user, and an Amazon S3 bucket. The service defines a set of
      actions that can be performed on each resource. If you create a request to perform an
      unrelated action on a resource, that request is denied. For example, if you request to delete
      an IAM role but provide an IAM group resource, the request fails. To see AWS service
      tables that identify which resources are affected by an action, see <a href="reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Actions, Resources, and
        Condition Keys for AWS Services</a>.</p>
