    (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when
    associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these
    policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies
    determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON
    documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based
    policies, permissions boundaries, Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies.</p><p>IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to
    perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html">GetUser</a> action, then a user with that policy can
    get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API. When you create an IAM
    user, you can choose to allow console or programmatic access. If console access is allowed, the
    IAM user can sign in to the console using their sign-in credentials. If programmatic access
    is allowed, the user can use access keys to work with the CLI or API.</p>
    <h2 id="access_policy-types">Policy types</h2>
    <p>The following policy types, listed in order from most frequently used to less frequently
      used, are available for use in AWS. For more details, see the sections below for each policy
      type.</p>

      <h3 id="policies_id-based">Identity-based policies</h3>
      <p>Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that control what actions
        an identity (users, groups of users, and roles) can perform, on which resources, and under
        what conditions. Identity-based policies can be further categorized:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p><a id="managedpolicy"></a><b>Managed policies</b> – Standalone identity-based
            policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account.
            There are two types of managed policies:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
          <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
              <p><b>AWS managed policies</b> – Managed
                policies that are created and managed by AWS.</p>

              <p><b>Customer managed policies</b> – Managed
                policies that you create and manage in your AWS account. Customer managed policies

            </li></ul></div>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><a id="inline"></a><b>Inline policies</b> – Policies that you add
            directly to a single user, group, or role. Inline policies maintain a strict one-to-one
            relationship between a policy and an identity. They are deleted when you delete the
            identity.</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>To learn how to choose between managed and inline policies, see <a href="./access_policies-choosing-managed-or-inline.html">Choosing between managed
            policies and inline policies</a>.</p>
     
     
      <h3 id="policies_resource-based">Resource-based policies</h3>
      <p>Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as
        an Amazon S3 bucket. These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific
        actions on that resource and defines under what conditions this applies. Resource-based
        policies are inline policies. There are no managed resource-based policies. </p>
      <p>To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities in
        another account as the principal in a resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account
        principal to a resource-based policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship.
        When the principal and the resource are in separate AWS accounts, you must also use an
        identity-based policy to grant the principal access to the resource. However, if a
        resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional
        identity-based policy is required. For step-by step instructions for granting cross-service
        access, see <a href="./tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html">IAM tutorial: Delegate access across AWS
         accounts using IAM roles</a>.</p>
      <p>The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role
          <em>trust policy</em>, which is attached to an IAM role. An
        IAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies. For
        that reason, you must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM
        role. Trust policies define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated
        users) can assume the role. To learn how IAM roles are different from other resource-based
        policies, see <a href="./id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How IAM roles differ from resource-based
      policies</a>.</p>
      <p>To see which other services support resource-based policies, see <a href="./reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">AWS services that work with
      IAM</a>. To learn more about
        resource-based policies, see <a href="./access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html">Identity-based policies and
         resource-based policies</a>. 
To learn whether principals in accounts outside of your zone of trust (trusted organization or account) have access to assume your roles, see 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">What is IAM Access Analyzer?</a>.</p>
     
     
      <h3 id="policies_bound">IAM permissions boundaries</h3>
      <p>A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions
        that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. When you set a permissions
        boundary for an entity, the entity can perform only the actions that are allowed by both its
        identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. Resource-based policies that specify
        the user or role as the principal are not limited by the permissions boundary. An explicit
        deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information about permissions
        boundaries, see <a href="./access_policies_boundaries.html">Permissions boundaries for IAM
            entities</a>.</p>
     
     
      <h3 id="policies_scp">Service control policies (SCPs)</h3>
      <p>AWS Organizations is a service for grouping and centrally managing the AWS accounts that your
        business owns. If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service
        control policies (SCPs) to any or all of your accounts. SCPs are JSON policies that specify
        the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU). The SCP limits
        permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. An explicit deny in
        any of these policies overrides the allow.</p>
      <p>For more information about Organizations and SCPs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_about-scps.html">How SCPs Work</a> in the
          <em>AWS Organizations User Guide</em>.</p>
     
     
      <h3 id="policies_acl">Access control lists (ACLs)</h3>
      <p>Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow you to control which
        principals in another account can access a resource. ACLs cannot be used to control access
        for a principal within the same account. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies,
        although they are the only policy type that does not use the JSON policy document format.
        Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs. To learn more about ACLs,
        see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> in
        the <em>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</em>.</p>
     
     
      <h3 id="policies_session">Session policies</h3>
      <p>Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you
        programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user. The permissions
        for a session are the intersection of the identity-based policies for the IAM entity (user
        or role) used to create the session and the session policies. Permissions can also come from
        a resource-based policy. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the
        allow.</p>
      <p>You can create role session and pass session policies programmatically using the
          <code class="code">AssumeRole</code>, <code class="code">AssumeRoleWithSAML</code>, or
          <code class="code">AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API operations. You can pass a single JSON inline
        session policy document using the <code class="code">Policy</code> parameter. You can use the
          <code class="code">PolicyArns</code> parameter to specify up to 10 managed session policies. For more
        information about creating a role session, see <a href="./id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting temporary security credentials</a>.</p>
      <p>When you create a federated user session, you use the access keys of the IAM user to
        programmatically call the <code class="code">GetFederationToken</code> API operation. You must also pass
        session policies. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the identity-based policy and the session policy. For more information about creating a
        federated user session, see <a href="./id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken">GetFederationToken—federation through a custom identity broker</a>.</p>
      <p>A resource-based policy can specify the ARN of the user or role as a principal. In that
        case, the permissions from the resource-based policy are added to the role or user's
        identity-based policy before the session is created. The session policy limits the total
        permissions granted by the resource-based policy and the identity-based policy. The
        resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the session policies and the
        resource-based policies plus the intersection of the session policies and identity-based policies.</p>
      <div class="mediaobject">

      </div>
      <p>A resource-based policy can specify the ARN of the session as a principal. In that case,
        the permissions from the resource-based policy are added after the session is created. The
        resource-based policy permissions are not limited by the session policy. The resulting
        session has all the permissions of the resource-based policy <em>plus</em> the intersection of the identity-based policy and the session
        policy.</p>

      </div>
      <p>A permissions boundary can set the maximum permissions for a user or role that is used
        to create a session. In that case, the resulting session's permissions are the intersection
        of the session policy, the permissions boundary, and the identity-based policy. However, a
        permissions boundary does not limit permissions granted by a resource-based policy that

    <h2 id="access_policies-root">Policies and the root user</h2>
    <p>The AWS account root user is affected by some policy types but not others. You cannot attach
      identity-based policies to the root user, and you cannot set the permissions boundary for the
      root user. However, you can specify the root user as the principal in a resource-based policy or an
      ACL. A root user is still the member of an account. If that account is a member of an
      organization in AWS Organizations, the root user is affected by any SCPs for the account.</p>
   
    <h2 id="access_policies-json">Overview of JSON policies</h2>
    <p>Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. Identity-based policies and policies
      used to set permissions boundaries are JSON policy documents that you attach to a user or
      role. Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. SCPs
      are JSON policy documents with restricted syntax that you attach to an AWS Organizations organizational
      unit (OU). ACLs are also attached to a resource, but you must use a different syntax. Session
      policies are JSON policies that you provide when you assume a role or federated user
      session.</p>
    <p>It is not necessary for you to understand the JSON syntax. You can use the visual editor
      in the AWS Management Console to create and edit customer managed policies without ever using JSON.
      However, if you use inline policies for groups or complex policies, you must still create and
      edit those policies in the JSON editor using the console. For more information about using the
      visual editor, see <a href="./access_policies_create.html">Creating IAM policies</a> and <a href="./access_policies_manage-edit.html">Editing IAM policies</a>.</p>
    <p>
When you create or edit a JSON policy, IAM can perform policy validation to help you create an effective policy. IAM identifies JSON syntax errors, while IAM Access Analyzer provides 
additional policy checks with recommendations to help you further refine your policies. To learn more about policy validation, see <a href="./access_policies_policy-validator.html">Validating IAM policies</a>.

      <h3 id="policies-introduction">JSON policy document structure</h3>
       
        <p>As illustrated in the following figure, a JSON policy document includes these
          elements:</p>
       
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">

        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>One or more individual statements<em></em></p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>Each statement includes information about a single permission. If a policy includes
        multiple statements, AWS applies a logical <code class="code">OR</code> across the statements when
        evaluating them. If multiple policies apply to a request, AWS applies a logical
          <code class="code">OR</code> across all of those policies when evaluating them. </p>

      <h3 id="policies-syntax-multiples">Multiple statements and multiple
          policies</h3>
       
        <p>If you want to define more than one permission for an entity (user or role), you can
          use multiple statements in a single policy. You can also attach multiple policies. If you
          try to define multiple permissions in a single statement, your policy might not grant the
          access that you expect. We recommend that you break up policies by resource type. </p>
       
      <p>Because of the <a href="./reference_iam-quotas.html">limited size of policies</a>, it
        might be necessary to use multiple policies for more complex permissions. It's also a good
        idea to create functional groupings of permissions in a separate customer managed policy.
        For example, Create one policy for IAM user management, one for self-management, and
        another policy for S3 bucket management. Regardless of the combination of multiple
        statements and multiple policies, AWS <a href="./reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html">evaluates</a> your policies the same way.</p>
      <p>For example, the following policy has three statements, each of which defines a separate
        set of permissions within a single account. The statements define the following:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p>The first statement, with an <code class="code">Sid</code> (Statement ID) of
              <code class="code">FirstStatement</code>, lets the user with the attached policy change their own
            password. The <code class="code">Resource</code> element in this statement is "<code class="code">*</code>" (which
            means "all resources"). But in practice, the <code class="code">ChangePassword</code> API operation
            (or equivalent <code class="code">change-password</code> CLI command) affects only the password for
            the user who makes the request. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>The second statement lets the user list all the Amazon S3 buckets in their AWS account.
            The <code class="code">Resource</code> element in this statement is <code class="code">"*"</code> (which means
            "all resources"). But because policies don't grant access to resources in other
            accounts, the user can list only the buckets in their own AWS account. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>The third statement lets the user list and retrieve any object that is in a bucket
            named <code class="code">confidential-data</code>, but only when the user is authenticated with
            multi-factor authentication (MFA). The <code class="code">Condition</code> element in the policy
            enforces the MFA authentication.</p>
          <p>When a policy statement contains a <code class="code">Condition</code> element, the statement is
            only in effect when the <code class="code">Condition</code> element evaluates to true. In this case,
            the <code class="code">Condition</code> evaluates to true when the user is MFA-authenticated. If the
            user is not MFA-authenticated, this <code class="code">Condition</code> evaluates to false. In that
            case, the third statement in this policy does not apply and the user does not have

    <h2 id="grant-least-priv">Grant least privilege</h2>
    <p>When you create IAM policies, follow the standard security advice of granting
        <em>least privilege</em>, or granting only the permissions required to perform
        a task. Determine what users and roles need to do and then craft policies that allow them
        to perform <em>only</em> those tasks. </p>
    <p>Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary.
        Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying
        to tighten them later.</p>
    <p>As an alternative to least privilege, you can use <a href="./access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies">AWS managed policies</a> or policies with wildcard <code class="code">*</code> permissions to get
        started with policies. Consider the security risk of granting your principals more
        permissions than they need to do their job. Monitor those principals to learn which
        permissions they are using. Then write least privilege policies.</p>
    <p>IAM provides several options to help you refine the permissions that you grant.</p>
