      privilege</a>, or granting only the permissions required to perform a task. The most secure
    way to grant least privilege is to write a custom policy with only the permissions needed by
    your team. You must create a process to allow your team to request more permissions when
    necessary. It takes time and expertise to <a href="./access_policies_create-console.html">create
      IAM customer managed policies</a> that provide your team with only the permissions they
    need.</p><p>To get started adding permissions to your IAM identities (users, groups of users, and
    roles), you can use <a href="./access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies">AWS managed policies</a>.
    AWS managed policies cover common use cases and are available in your AWS account. AWS
    managed policies don't grant least privilege permissions. You must consider the security risk of
    granting your principals more permissions than they need to do their job.</p><p>You can attach AWS managed policies, including job functions, to any IAM identity. To
    switch to least privilege permissions, you can run AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer to monitor principals with
    AWS managed policies. After learning which permissions they are using, then you can write a
    custom policy or generate a policy with only the required permissions for your team. This is
    less secure, but provides more flexibility as you learn how your team is using AWS.</p><p>AWS managed policies for job functions are designed to closely align to common job
    functions in the IT industry. You can use these policies to grant the permissions needed to
    carry out the tasks expected of someone in a specific job function. These policies consolidate
    permissions for many services into a single policy that's easier to work with than having
    permissions scattered across many policies.</p>
    <h6>Use Roles to Combine Services</h6>
    <p>Some of the policies use IAM service roles to help you take advantage of features found
      in other AWS services. These policies grant access to <code class="code">iam:passrole</code>, which
      allows a user with the policy to pass a role to an AWS service. This role delegates IAM
      permissions to the AWS service to carry out actions on your behalf.</p>
  <p>You must create the roles according to your needs. For example, the Network Administrator
    policy allows a user with the policy to pass a role named "flow-logs-vpc" to the Amazon CloudWatch
    service. CloudWatch uses that role to log and capture IP traffic for VPCs created by the user.</p><p>To follow security best practices, the policies for job functions include filters that limit
    the names of valid roles that can be passed. This helps avoid granting unnecessary permissions.
    If your users do require the optional service roles, you must create a role that follows the
    naming convention specified in the policy. You then grant permissions to the role. Once that is
    done, the user can configure the service to use the role, granting it whatever permissions the
    role provides.</p><p>In the following sections, each policy's name is a link to the policy details page in the
    AWS Management Console. There you can see the policy document and review the permissions it grants.</p>
