    security credentials that can control access to your AWS resources. Temporary security
    credentials work almost identically to long-term access key credentials, with the following
    differences:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p>Temporary security credentials are <em>short-term</em>, as the
        name implies. They can be configured to last for anywhere from a few minutes to several
        hours. After the credentials expire, AWS no longer recognizes them or allows any kind of
        access from API requests made with them.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>Temporary security credentials are not stored with the user but are generated
        dynamically and provided to the user when requested. When (or even before) the temporary
        security credentials expire, the user can request new credentials, as long as the user
        requesting them still has permissions to do so.</p>
    </li></ul></div><p>As a result, temporary credentials have the following advantages over long-term
    credentials:</p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p>You do not have to distribute or embed long-term AWS security credentials with an
        application.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>You can provide access to your AWS resources to users without having to define an
        AWS identity for them. Temporary credentials are the basis for <a href="./id_roles.html">roles and identity federation</a>.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p>The temporary security credentials have a limited lifetime, so you do not have to rotate
        them or explicitly revoke them when they're no longer needed. After temporary security
        credentials expire, they cannot be reused. You can specify how long the credentials are
        valid, up to a maximum limit. </p>
    </li></ul></div>
    <h2 id="sts-regionalization">AWS STS and AWS regions</h2>


    <p>Temporary security credentials are generated by AWS STS. By default, AWS STS is a global
      service with a single endpoint at <code class="code">https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. However, you
      can also choose to make AWS STS API calls to endpoints in any other supported Region. This can
      reduce latency (server lag) by sending the requests to servers in a Region that is
      geographically closer to you. No matter which Region your credentials come from, they work
      globally. For more information, see <a href="./id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Managing AWS STS in an AWS Region</a>.</p>
   
    <h2 id="sts-introduction">Common scenarios for temporary credentials</h2>

    <p>Temporary credentials are useful in scenarios that involve identity federation,
      delegation, cross-account access, and IAM roles.</p>

     
      <h3 id="id-federation">Identity federation</h3>

      <p>You can manage your user identities in an external system outside of AWS and grant
        users who sign in from those systems access to perform AWS tasks and access your AWS
        resources. IAM supports two types of identity federation. In both cases, the identities
        are stored outside of AWS. The distinction is where the external system resides—in
        your data center or an external third party on the web. For more information about external
        identity providers, see <a href="./id_roles_providers.html">Identity providers and federation</a>.</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
         
         
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>Enterprise identity federation</b> – You can
            authenticate users in your organization's network, and then provide those users access
            to AWS without creating new AWS identities for them and requiring them to sign in
            with different sign-in credentials. This is known as the <em>single
              sign-on</em> approach to temporary access. AWS STS supports open standards
            like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, with which you can use Microsoft AD
            FS to leverage your Microsoft Active Directory. You can also use SAML 2.0 to manage your
            own solution for federating user identities. For more information, see <a href="./id_roles_providers_saml.html">About SAML 2.0-based federation</a>.</p>

      access to the AWS console</a>.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
              <p><b>Federation using SAML 2.0</b> – You can use
                your organization's authentication system and SAML to grant access to AWS
                resources. For more information and an example scenario, see <a href="./id_roles_providers_saml.html">About SAML 2.0-based federation</a>.</p>
            </li></ul></div>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p><b>Web identity federation</b> – You can let users
            sign in using a well-known third-party identity provider such as Login with Amazon,
            Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC) 2.0 compatible provider. You can exchange
            the credentials from that provider for temporary permissions to use resources in your
            AWS account. This is known as the <em>web identity federation</em>
            approach to temporary access. When you use web identity federation for your mobile or
            web application, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user
            identities. Using web identity federation helps you keep your AWS account secure,
            because you don't have to distribute long-term security credentials, such as IAM user
            access keys, with your application. For more information, see <a href="./id_roles_providers_oidc.html">About web identity federation</a>.</p>
          <p> AWS STS web identity federation supports Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, and any
            OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible identity provider.</p>

              with AWS SDKs for mobile development to create unique identities for users and authenticate them for
              secure access to your AWS resources. Amazon Cognito supports the same identity providers as
              AWS STS, and also supports unauthenticated (guest) access and lets you migrate user data
              when a user signs in. Amazon Cognito also provides API operations for synchronizing user data
              so that it is preserved as users move between devices.

      <h3 id="role_cross-account">Roles for cross-account access</h3>

      <p>Many organizations maintain more than one AWS account. Using roles and cross-account
        access, you can define user identities in one account, and use those identities to access
        AWS resources in other accounts that belong to your organization. This is known as the
          <em>delegation</em> approach to temporary access. For more information about
        creating cross-account roles, see <a href="./id_roles_create_for-user.html">Creating a role to delegate permissions to an IAM
      user</a>. 
To learn whether principals in accounts outside of your zone of trust (trusted organization or account) have access to assume your roles, see 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">What is IAM Access Analyzer?</a>.</p>
     

     
      <h3 id="role_ec2">Roles for Amazon EC2</h3>

      <p>If you run applications on Amazon EC2 instances and those applications need access to AWS
        resources, you can provide temporary security credentials to your instances when you launch
        them. These temporary security credentials are available to all applications that run on the
        instance, so you don't need to store any long-term credentials on the instance. For more
        information, see <a href="./id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM role to grant permissions to
      applications running on Amazon EC2 instances</a>. </p>
     

     
      <h3 id="other-services">Other AWS services</h3>


      <p>You can use temporary security credentials to access most AWS services. For a list of
        the services that accept temporary security credentials, see <a href="./reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">AWS services that work with
