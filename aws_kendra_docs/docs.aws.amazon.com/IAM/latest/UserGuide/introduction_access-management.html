    is allowed to do in an account. A principal entity is a person or application that is
    authenticated using an IAM entity (user or role). Access management is often referred to as
      <em>authorization</em>. You manage access in AWS by creating policies and
    attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A
    policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their
    permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal uses an IAM entity (user or role)
    to make a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or
    denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about policy
    types and uses, see <a href="./access_policies.html">Policies and permissions in IAM</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="intro-access-accounts">Policies and accounts</h2>
    <p>If you manage a single account in AWS, then you define the permissions within that
      account using policies. If you manage permissions across multiple accounts, it is more
      difficult to manage permissions for your users. You can use IAM roles, resource-based
      policies, or access control lists (ACLs) for cross-account permissions. However, if you own
      multiple accounts, we instead recommend using the AWS Organizations service to help you manage those
      permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html">What
        is AWS Organizations?</a> in the <em>Organizations User Guide</em>.</p>
   
    <h2 id="intro-access-users">Policies and users</h2>
    <p>IAM users are identities in the service. When you create an IAM user, they can't
      access anything in your account until you give them permission. You give permissions to a user
      by creating an identity-based policy, which is a policy that is attached to the user or a
      group to which the user belongs. The following example shows a JSON policy that allows the
      user to perform all Amazon DynamoDB actions (<code class="code">dynamodb:*</code>) on the <code class="code">Books</code>
      table in the <code class="code">123456789012</code> account within the
        <code class="code">us-east-2</code> Region.</p>
    <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class=""><span>{</span>
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": <span>{</span>
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "dynamodb:*",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:123456789012:table/Books"
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p> After you attach this policy to your IAM user, the user only has those DynamoDB
      permissions. Most users have multiple policies that together represent the permissions for
      that user.</p>
    <p>Actions or resources that are not explicitly allowed are denied by default. For example,
      if the preceding policy is the only policy that is attached to a user, then that user is
      allowed to only perform DynamoDB actions on the <code class="code">Books</code> table. Actions on all other
      tables are prohibited. Similarly, the user is not allowed to perform any actions in Amazon EC2,
      Amazon S3, or in any other AWS service. The reason is that permissions to work with those
      services are not included in the policy. </p>
    
    
    
    
   
    <h2 id="intro-access-groups">Policies and groups</h2>
    <p>You can organize IAM users into <em>IAM groups</em> and attach a policy to
      a group. In that case, individual users still have their own credentials, but all the users in
      a group have the permissions that are attached to the group. Use groups for easier permissions
      management, and to follow our <a href="./best-practices.html">Security best practices in IAM</a>. </p>
    <div class="mediaobject">
       
        <img src="/images/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/iam-intro-users-and-groups.diagram.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding" alt="&#xA;        Users can be organized into groups to make it easier to manage permissions, because&#xA;          users have the permissions assigned to a group.&#xA;      " />
       
       
    </div>
    <p>Users or groups can have multiple policies attached to them that grant different
      permissions. In that case, the permissions for the users are calculated based on the combination of
      policies. But the basic principle still applies: If the user has not been granted an explicit
      permission for an action and a resource, the user does not have those permissions. </p>
   
    <h2 id="intro-access-roles">Federated users and roles</h2>
    <p>Federated users don't have permanent identities in your AWS account the way that IAM
      users do. To assign permissions to federated users, you can create an entity referred to as a
        <em>role</em> and define permissions for the role. When a federated user signs
      in to AWS, the user is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are
      defined in the role. For more information, see <a href="./id_roles_create_for-idp.html">Creating a role for a third-party Identity Provider
      (federation)</a>.</p>
   
      <h2 id="intro-access-resource-based-policies">Identity-based and resource-based policies</h2>
      <p>Identity-based policies are permissions policies that you attach to an IAM identity, such as an IAM user, group, or role. Resource-based
         policies are permissions policies that you attach to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an IAM role trust policy.</p>
      <p><b><em>Identity-based
        policies</em></b> control what actions the identity can perform, on which
      resources, and under what conditions. Identity-based policies can be further
      categorized:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
          
          
      <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Managed policies</b> – Standalone identity-based policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups,
               and roles in your AWS account. You can use two types of managed policies: </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                
                
            <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                  <p><b>AWS managed policies</b> – Managed policies that are created and managed by AWS. If you are new
                     to using policies, we recommend that you start by using AWS managed policies.</p>
               </li><li class="listitem">
                  <p><b>Customer managed policies</b> – Managed
              policies that you create and manage in your AWS account. Customer managed policies
              provide more precise control over your policies than AWS managed policies.
              You can create,
              edit, and validate an IAM policy in the visual editor or by
              creating the JSON policy document directly. For more information, see <a href="./access_policies_create.html">Creating IAM policies</a> and <a href="./access_policies_manage-edit.html">Editing IAM policies</a>.</p>
               </li></ul></div>
         </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><b>Inline policies</b> – Policies that you create
          and manage and that are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. In most
          cases, we don't recommend using inline policies.</p>
         </li></ul></div>
      <p><b><em>Resource-based
        policies</em></b> control what actions a specified principal can perform on
      that resource and under what conditions. Resource-based policies are inline policies, and
      there are no managed resource-based policies. To enable cross-account access, you can specify
      an entire account or IAM entities in another account as the principal in a resource-based
      policy.</p>
      <p>The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role
        <em>trust policy</em>, which is attached to an IAM role. Because
      an IAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies, you
      must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM role. Trust policies
      define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the
      role. To learn how IAM roles are different from other resource-based policies, see <a href="./id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How IAM roles differ from resource-based
      policies</a>.</p>

      IAM</a>. To learn more about resource-based policies, see <a href="./access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html">Identity-based policies and
