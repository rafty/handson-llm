    However, because permissions are evaluated each time an AWS request is made using the
    credentials, you can achieve the effect of revoking the credentials by changing the permissions
    for the credentials even after they have been issued. If you remove all permissions from the
    temporary security credentials, subsequent AWS requests that use those credentials will fail.

    <p>To change or remove the permissions assigned to temporary security credentials, you can
      change or remove the permissions that are associated with the creator of the credentials. The
      creator of the credentials is determined by the AWS STS API that was used to obtain the
      credentials. The mechanisms for changing or removing the permissions associated with this
      creator are explained in the following sections. </p>

    <h3 id="denying-access-to-credentials-creator-roles">Denying access to credentials
        created by AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</h3>
      
      <p>To change or remove the permissions assigned to the temporary security credentials
        obtained by calling the <code class="code">AssumeRole</code>, <code class="code">AssumeRoleWithSAML</code>, or
          <code class="code">AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API operations, you edit or delete the role
        permission policy that defines the permissions for the assumed role. The temporary security
        credentials obtained by assuming a role can never have more permissions than those defined
        in the permissions policy of the assumed role, and the permissions assigned to temporary
        security credentials are evaluated each time they are used to make an AWS request. When
        you edit or delete the permission policy of a role, the changes affect the permissions of
            <em><b>all</b></em> temporary security credentials
        associated with that role, including credentials that were issued before you changed the
        role's permissions policy. You can immediately revoke all permissions to a session by
        following the steps at <a href="./id_roles_use_revoke-sessions.html">Revoking IAM role temporary security
      credentials</a>.</p>
      <p>For more information about editing a role permission policy, see <a href="./id_roles_manage_modify.html">Modifying a role</a>. </p>

      <p>To change or remove the permissions assigned to the temporary security credentials

        operations, you edit or delete the policies that are attached to the IAM user whose
        credentials were used to call <code class="code">GetFederationToken</code> or
          <code class="code">GetSessionToken</code>. The temporary security credentials that were obtained by
        calling <code class="code">GetFederationToken</code> or <code class="code">GetSessionToken</code> can never have more
        permissions than the IAM user whose credentials were used to obtain them. In addition the
        permissions assigned to temporary security credentials are evaluated each time they are used
        to make an AWS request. It is important to note that when you edit or delete the
        permissions of an IAM user, the changes affect the IAM user as well as all temporary
        security credentials created by that user.</p>

  <h2 id="denying-access-to-credentials-by-name">Denying access to temporary security
      credentials by name</h2>
    

    <p>You can deny access to temporary security credentials without affecting the permissions of
      the IAM user or role that created the credentials. You do this by specifying the Amazon
      Resource Name (ARN) of the temporary security credentials in the <code class="code">Principal</code>
      element of a resource-based policy. (Only some AWS services support resource-based
      policies.)</p>

    <h3 id="denying-access-by-name-get-federation-token">Denying access to federated
        users</h3>
      
      <p>For example, imagine you have an IAM user named <code class="code">token-app</code> whose
        credentials are used to call <code class="code">GetFederationToken</code>. The
          <code class="code">GetFederationToken</code> API call resulted in temporary security credentials
        associated with a federated user named Bob (the federated user's name is taken from the
          <code class="code">Name</code> parameter of the API call). To deny federated user Bob's access to an S3
        bucket called EXAMPLE-BUCKET, you attach the following example bucket policy to
        EXAMPLE-BUCKET. It is important to note that this affects the federated user's Amazon S3
        permissions only—any other permissions granted to the federated user remain intact. </p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="json "><span>{</span>
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": <span>{</span>
    "Principal": <span>{</span>"AWS": "arn:aws:sts::<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:federated-user/Bob"},
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::EXAMPLE-BUCKET"
  }
}</code></pre>
      <p>You can specify the ARN of the IAM user whose credentials were used to call
          <code class="code">GetFederationToken</code> in the <code class="code">Principal</code> element of the bucket
        policy, instead of specifying the federated user. In that case, the <code class="code">Principal</code>
        element of the preceding policy would look like this:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"></div><code class="json ">"Principal": <span>{</span>"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:user/token-app"}</code></pre>
      <p>It is important to note that specifying the ARN of IAM user <code class="code">token-app</code> in
        the policy will result in denying access to <em><b>all</b></em> federated users created by <code class="code">token-app</code>, not only the
        federated user named Bob. </p>
     
    <h3 id="denying-access-by-name-assume-role">Denying access to assumed role
        users</h3>
      
      <p>It is also possible to specify the ARN of the temporary security credentials that were
        created by assuming a role. The difference is the syntax used in the <code class="code">Principal</code>
        element of the resource-based policy. For example, a user assumes a role called
          <code class="code">Accounting-Role</code> and specifies a <code class="code">RoleSessionName</code> of
          <code class="code">Mary</code> (<code class="code">RoleSessionName</code> is a parameter of the
          <code class="code">AssumeRole</code> API call). To deny access to the temporary security credentials
        that resulted from this API call, the <code class="code">Principal</code> element of the resource-based
        policy would look like this:</p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"></div><code class="nohighlight">"Principal": <span>{</span>"AWS": "arn:aws:sts::<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:assumed-role/Accounting-Role/Mary"}</code></pre>
      <p>You can also specify the ARN of the IAM role in the <code class="code">Principal</code> element of
        a resourced-based policy, as in the following example. In this case, the policy will result
        in denying access to <em><b>all</b></em> temporary
        security credentials associated with the role named <code class="code">Accounting-Role</code>. </p>
      <pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"></div><code class="nohighlight">"Principal": <span>{</span>"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<code class="replaceable">account-id</code>:role/Accounting-Role"}</code></pre>
     
  <h2 id="denying-access-to-credentials-by-issue-time">Denying access to temporary
      security credentials issued before a specific time</h2>
    
    <p>It is possible to deny access only to temporary security credentials that were created
      before a specific time and date. You do this by specifying a value for the
        <code class="code">aws:TokenIssueTime</code> key in the <code class="code">Condition</code> element of a policy. The
      following policy shows an example. You attach a policy similar to the following example to the
      IAM user that created the temporary security credentials. The policy denies all permissions
      but only when the value of <code class="code">aws:TokenIssueTime</code> is earlier than the specified date
      and time. The value of <code class="code">aws:TokenIssueTime</code> corresponds to the exact time at which
      the temporary security credentials were created. The <code class="code">aws:TokenIssueTime</code> value is
      only present in the context of AWS requests that are signed with temporary security
      credentials, so the <code class="code">Deny</code> statement in the policy will not affect requests that
      are signed with the long-term credentials of the IAM user. </p>
    <p>The following policy can also be attached to a role. In that case, the policy affects only
      the temporary security credentials that were created by the role before the specified date and
      time. If the credentials were created by the role after the specified date and time, the
        <code class="code">Condition</code> element in the policy is evaluated to false, so the <code class="code">Deny</code>
      statement has no effect.</p>
    <div class="example"><h6>Example policy that denies all permissions to temporary credentials by issue time</h6><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting"><div class="code-btn-container"><div class="btn-copy-code" title="Copy"><awsui-icon name="copy"></awsui-icon></div></div><code class="json "><span>{</span>
  "Version": "2012-10-17",

  }
}</code></pre></div></div>
    <p>Valid users whose sessions are revoked in this way must acquire temporary credentials for
      a new session to continue working. Note that the AWS CLI caches credentials until they expire.
      To force the CLI to delete and refresh cached credentials that are no longer valid, run one of
      the following commands:</p>
    <p><b>Linux, MacOS, or Unix</b></p>
