    IAM identity represents a human user or programmatic workload, and can be authenticated and
    then authorized to perform actions in AWS. Each IAM identity can be associated with one or
    more <em>policies</em>. Policies determine what actions a user, role, or member of a

    <h2 id="id_root"><a href="./id_root-user.html">AWS account root user</a></h2>
    

 <p>When you first create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services

    <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a></em> is an identity
      within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application.
      Where possible, <a href="./best-practices.html">best practices</a> recommend relying on
      temporary credentials instead of creating IAM users who have long-term credentials such as
      passwords and access keys. However, if you have specific use cases that require long-term
      credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate access keys. For more information,
      see <a href="./best-practices.html#rotate-credentials">Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require
          long-term credentials</a>.To add IAM users
      to your AWS account, see <a href="./id_users_create.html">Creating an IAM user in your AWS account</a>.</p>


   
    <h2 id="id_iam-groups"><a href="./id_groups.html">IAM user groups</a></h2>
    <p>An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html"><em>IAM group</em></a> is
      an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users. You can't use a group to sign-in.
      You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make
      permissions easier to manage for large sets of users. For example, you could have a group
      named <em>IAMPublishers</em> and give that group the types of permissions that
      publishing workloads typically need.</p>
   
    <h2 id="id_iam-roles"><a href="./id_roles.html">IAM roles</a></h2>
    <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM
        role</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that has specific
      permissions. It is similar to an IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person. You
      can temporarily assume an IAM role in the AWS Management Console by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html">switching roles</a>. You can
      assume a role by calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more
      information about methods for using roles, see <a href="./id_roles_use.html">Using IAM roles</a>.</p>
    <p>IAM roles with temporary credentials are used in the following situations:</p>

    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Federated user access</b> –
          

To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role and define permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by the role. For information about roles for federation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html">
Creating a role for a third-party Identity Provider</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

<span>If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set. To control what your identities can access after they authenticate, IAM Identity Center correlates the permission set to a role in IAM.

        <p><b>Cross-account access</b> – You can use an IAM

          your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, with some
          AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource (instead of using a role as
          a proxy). To learn the difference between roles and resource-based policies for
          cross-account access, see <a href="./id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How IAM roles differ from resource-based

      Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, 
      it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this 
      using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role.

              –

      When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies 
      grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers 
      another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To 
      see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_identityandaccessmanagement.html">Actions, resources, and condition keys for AWS Identity and Access Management</a> in the

      actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For

      A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. 
      Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view,

        <p><b>Applications running on Amazon EC2</b>

      You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. 
      This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it 
      available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the 
      instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to
      get temporary credentials. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances</a> in the

    <p>As a <a href="./best-practices.html">best practice</a>, use temporary credentials with
      both human users and workloads. Temporary credentials are primarily used with IAM roles, but
      there are also other uses. You can request temporary credentials that have a more restricted
      set of permissions than your standard IAM user. This prevents you from accidentally
      performing tasks that are not permitted by the more restricted credentials. A benefit of
      temporary credentials is that they expire automatically after a set period of time. You have
      control over the duration that the credentials are valid.</p>

        user)</h2>

    <p>Create an IAM role in the following situations:</p>
    <div class="variablelist">
       
       
       
    <dl>
        <dt><b><span class="term">You're creating an application that runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance and that
          application makes requests to AWS.</span></b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Don't create an IAM user and pass the user's credentials to the application or
            embed the credentials in the application. Instead, create an IAM role that you attach
            to the EC2 instance to give temporary security credentials to applications running on
            the instance. When an application uses these credentials in AWS, it can perform all of
            the operations that are allowed by the policies attached to the role. For details, see
              <a href="./id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM role to grant permissions to
      applications running on Amazon EC2 instances</a>.</p>

          AWS.</span></b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Don't create an IAM user and distribute the user's access key with the app.
            Instead, use an identity provider like Login with Amazon, Amazon Cognito, Facebook, or
            Google to authenticate users and map the users to an IAM role. The app can use the
            role to get temporary security credentials that have the permissions specified by the
            policies attached to the role. For more information, see the following: </p>
