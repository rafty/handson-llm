    requests. You could have your developers store AWS credentials directly within the Amazon EC2
    instance and allow applications in that instance to use those credentials. But developers would
    then have to manage the credentials and ensure that they securely pass the credentials to each
    instance and update each Amazon EC2 instance when it's time to rotate the credentials. That's a lot
    of additional work.</p><p>Instead, you can and should use an IAM role to manage <em>temporary</em> credentials for applications that run on an Amazon EC2 instance. When you use
    a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a sign-in credentials or
    access keys) to an Amazon EC2 instance. Instead, the role supplies temporary permissions that
    applications can use when they make calls to other AWS resources. When you launch an Amazon EC2
    instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with the instance. Applications that run on the
    instance can then use the role-supplied temporary credentials to sign API requests.</p><p>Using roles to grant permissions to applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances requires a bit
    of extra configuration. An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance is abstracted from AWS by
    the virtualized operating system. Because of this extra separation, you need an additional step
    to assign an AWS role and its associated permissions to an Amazon EC2 instance and make them
    available to its applications. This extra step is the creation of an <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html">instance
        profile</a></em> attached to the instance. The instance profile contains the role
    and can provide the role's temporary credentials to an application that runs on the instance.
    Those temporary credentials can then be used in the application's API calls to access resources
    and to limit access to only those resources that the role specifies. Note that only one role can
    be assigned to an Amazon EC2 instance at a time, and all applications on the instance share the same
    role and permissions.</p><p>Using roles in this way has several benefits. Because role credentials are temporary and
    rotated automatically, you don't have to manage credentials, and you don't have to worry about
    long-term security risks. In addition, if you use a single role for multiple instances, you can
    make a change to that one role and the change propagates automatically to all the instances. </p><div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>Although a role is usually assigned to an Amazon EC2 instance when you launch it, a role can

        work?</h2>
    <p>In the following figure, a developer runs an application on an Amazon EC2 instance that
      requires access to the S3 bucket named <code class="code">photos</code>. An administrator creates the
        <code class="code">Get-pics</code> service role and attaches the role to the Amazon EC2 instance. The role
      includes a permissions policy that grants read-only access to the specified S3 bucket. It also
      includes a trust policy that allows the Amazon EC2 instance to assume the role and retrieve the
      temporary credentials. When the application runs on the instance, it can use the role's
      temporary credentials to access the photos bucket. The administrator doesn't have to grant the
      developer permission to access the photos bucket, and the developer never has to share or
      manage credentials.</p>

            as separate steps. Then, when you launch the instance, you must specify the instance
            profile name instead of the role name.</p></div></div>
      </li><li>
        <p>When the application runs, it obtains temporary security credentials from Amazon EC2 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">instance metadata</a>, as described
          in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#instance-metadata-security-credentials">Retrieving Security Credentials from Instance Metadata</a>. These are <a href="./id_credentials_temp.html">temporary security credentials</a> that represent the
          role and are valid for a limited period of time. </p>
        <p>With some <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS SDKs</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>, the developer can
          use a provider that manages the temporary security credentials transparently. (The
          documentation for individual AWS SDKs describes the features supported by that SDK for
          managing credentials.)</p>
        <p>Alternatively, the application can get the temporary credentials directly from the
          instance metadata of the Amazon EC2 instance. Credentials and related values are available from
          the <code class="code">iam/security-credentials/<code class="replaceable">role-name</code></code> category
          (in this case, <code class="code">iam/security-credentials/Get-pics</code>) of the metadata. If the
          application gets the credentials from the instance metadata, it can cache the
          credentials.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p>Using the retrieved temporary credentials, the application accesses the photo bucket.
          Because of the policy attached to the <code class="userinput">Get-pics</code> role, the
          application has read-only permissions. </p>
        <p>The temporary security credentials available on the instance automatically rotate
          before they expire so that a valid set is always available. The application just needs to
          make sure that it gets a new set of credentials from the instance metadata before the
          current ones expire. It is possible to use the AWS SDK to manage credentials so the
          application does not need to include additional logic to refresh the credentials. For
          example, instantiating clients with Instance Profile Credential Providers. However, if the
          application gets temporary security credentials from the instance metadata and has cached
          them, it should get a refreshed set of credentials every hour, or at least 15 minutes
          before the current set expires. The expiration time is included in the information
          returned in the <code class="code">iam/security-credentials/<code class="replaceable">role-name</code></code>
          category. </p>

    <h2 id="roles-usingrole-ec2instance-permissions">Permissions required for using roles
        with Amazon EC2</h2>
    <p>To launch an instance with a role, the developer must have permission to launch Amazon EC2
      instances and permission to pass IAM roles.</p>
    <p>The following sample policy allows users to use the AWS Management Console to launch an instance with a

      <h3 id="roles-usingrole-ec2instance-passrole">Restricting which roles can be passed
          to Amazon EC2 instances (using PassRole)</h3>
      <p>You can use the <code class="code">PassRole</code> permission to restrict which role a user can pass
        to an Amazon EC2 instance when the user launches the instance. This helps prevent the user from
        running applications that have more permissions than the user has been granted—that
        is, from being able to obtain elevated privileges. For example, imagine that user Alice has
        permissions only to launch Amazon EC2 instances and to work with Amazon S3 buckets, but the role she
        passes to an Amazon EC2 instance has permissions to work with IAM and Amazon DynamoDB. In that case,
        Alice might be able to launch the instance, log into it, get temporary security credentials,
        and then perform IAM or DynamoDB actions that she's not authorized for.</p>
      <p>To restrict which roles a user can pass to an Amazon EC2 instance, you create a policy that
        allows the <code class="code">PassRole</code> action. You then attach the policy to the user (or to an
        IAM group that the user belongs to) who will launch Amazon EC2 instances. In the
          <code class="code">Resource</code> element of the policy, you list the role or roles that the user is
        allowed to pass to Amazon EC2 instances. When the user launches an instance and associates a role
        with it, Amazon EC2 checks whether the user is allowed to pass that role. Of course, you should
        also ensure that the role that the user can pass does not include more permissions than the
        user is supposed to have.</p>
      <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p><code class="code">PassRole</code> is not an API action in the same way that
            <code class="code">RunInstances</code> or <code class="code">ListInstanceProfiles</code> is. Instead, it's a
          permission that AWS checks whenever a role ARN is passed as a parameter to an API (or
          the console does this on the user's behalf). It helps an administrator to control which
          roles can be passed by which users. In this case, it ensures that the user is allowed to
          attach a specific role to an Amazon EC2 instance.</p></div></div>
      <div class="example"><h6>Example policy that grants a user permission to launch an Amazon EC2 instance with a

          an instance, the action fails. The user does have permissions to run any instance,

    <h2 id="roles-usingrole-ec2instance-get-started">How do I get started?</h2>
    <p>To understand how roles work with Amazon EC2 instances, you need to use the IAM console to
      create a role, launch an Amazon EC2 instance that uses that role, and then examine the running
      instance. You can examine the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html">instance metadata</a> to see how the role's temporary credentials are made available to
      an instance. You can also see how an application that runs on an instance can use the role.
