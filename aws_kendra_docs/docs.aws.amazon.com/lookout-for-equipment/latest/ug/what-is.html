  abnormal equipment behavior and identifies potential failures. With Lookout for Equipment, you can implement
  predictive maintenance programs and identify suboptimal equipment processes. </p><p>Amazon Lookout for Equipment doesn't require extensive ML knowledge or experience. You upload historical data
  generated by your industrial equipment to train a custom ML model that finds potential failures by
  leveraging up to 300 sensors into a single model. Lookout for Equipment automatically creates the best model
  to learn your equipment's normal operating conditions. The model is optimized to find abnormal equipment
  behavior that occurred in the historical data. Using either the AWS console or the
  AWS SDK, you run the model to process new sensor data in real time. </p><p>To use Amazon Lookout for Equipment, you do the following: </p><div class="orderedlist">
   
   
   
   
   
   
 <ol><li>
   <p>Format and upload your historical data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. You can use data from
    process historians, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, or another
    condition monitoring system. Format and upload data showing the periods of  failures or abnormal
    behavior in your historical data, if you have it. </p>
  </li><li>
   <p>Create a dataset from the data that you've uploaded.</p>
  </li><li>
   <p>Choose the data in the dataset that is relevant to the asset whose behavior you want to
    analyze.</p>
  </li><li>
   <p>Add the periods of historical failures shown in the data, if you have it.</p>
  </li><li>
   <p>Train your ML model using Lookout for Equipment.</p>
  </li><li>
   <p>After fine-tuning the model, deploy it to monitor data in real time.</p>
  </li></ol></div><p>Lookout for Equipment is designed to monitor fixed and stationary industrial equipment that operates continuously,
  with limited variability in operating conditions. This includes rotating equipment such as pumps,
  compressors, motors, and turbines. It is also targeted for Process industries with applications such as 
  heat exchangers, boilers, and inverters. 
  
  Lookout for Equipment is a back-end analytics service, meant to supplement, and plug into, existing systems. It may not be ideal for equipment with significantly
  variable operating conditions, such as vehicles, robots, appliances, and computer numerical
  control (CNC) machines. </p><div class="highlights" id="inline-topiclist"><h6>Topics</h6><ul><li><a href="#first-time">Are you a first-time user of Lookout for Equipment?</a></li><li><a href="#pricing">Pricing for Amazon Lookout for Equipment</a></li></ul></div>
