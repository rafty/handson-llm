  following prescriptive best practices. AWS Control Tower <em>orchestrates</em>
  the capabilities of several other <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/integrated-services.html">AWS services</a>, including 
  AWS Organizations, AWS Service Catalog, and AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On), to build a landing zone in less than
  an hour. Resources are set up and managed on your behalf. </p><p>AWS Control Tower orchestration extends the capabilities of AWS Organizations. To help keep your
  organizations and accounts from <em>drift</em>, which is divergence from
  best practices, AWS Control Tower applies controls (sometimes called <em>guardrails</em>). For example, you
  can use controls to help ensure that security logs and necessary cross-account access
  permissions are created, and not altered.</p><p>If you are hosting more than a handful of accounts, it’s beneficial to have an orchestration
  layer that facilitates account deployment and account governance. You can adopt AWS Control Tower as your
  primary way to provision accounts and infrastructure. With AWS Control Tower, you can more easily adhere to
  corporate standards, meet regulatory requirements, and follow best practices.</p><p>AWS Control Tower enables end users on your distributed teams to provision new AWS accounts quickly,
  by means of configurable account templates in Account Factory. Meanwhile, your central cloud
  administrators can monitor that all accounts are aligned with established, company-wide compliance
  policies.</p><p>In short, AWS Control Tower offers the easiest way to set up and govern a secure, compliant,
  multi-account AWS environment based on best practices established by working with thousands of
  enterprises. For more information about the working with AWS Control Tower and the best practices outlined
  in the AWS multi-account strategy, see <a href="./aws-multi-account-landing-zone.html#multi-account-guidance">AWS multi-account strategy: Best practices
                guidance</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
  <p>AWS Control Tower has the following features:</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist">
    
    
    
    
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
    <p><b>Landing zone</b> – A landing zone is a well-architected,
      <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/appendix-e-establish-multi-account.html#example-workloads-flat-structure">multi-account environment</a> that's based on security and compliance best practices. It
     is the enterprise-wide container that holds all of your organizational units (OUs), accounts,
     users, and other resources that you want to be subject to compliance regulation. A landing zone
     can scale to fit the needs of an enterprise of any size.</p>
   </li><li class="listitem">
    <p><b>Controls</b> – A control (sometimes called a <em>guardrail</em>) is a high-level rule that
     provides ongoing governance for your overall AWS environment. It's expressed in plain language.
     Three kinds of controls exist: <em>preventive</em>, <em>detective</em>, and <em>proactive</em>. Three categories of guidance apply to
     controls: <em>mandatory</em>, <em>strongly recommended</em>, or
      <em>elective</em>. For more information about controls, see <a href="./how-control-tower-works.html#how-controls-work">How controls work</a>.</p>
   </li><li class="listitem">
    <p><b>Account Factory</b> – An Account Factory is a configurable
     account template that helps to standardize the provisioning of new accounts with pre-approved
     account configurations. AWS Control Tower offers a built-in Account Factory that helps automate the account
     provisioning workflow in your organization. For more information, see <a href="./account-factory.html">Provision and manage accounts with Account Factory</a>.</p>
   </li><li class="listitem">
    <p><b>Dashboard</b> – The dashboard offers continuous
     oversight of your landing zone to your team of central cloud administrators. Use the dashboard to
     see provisioned accounts across your enterprise, controls enabled for policy enforcement,
     controls enabled for continuous detection of policy non-conformance, and noncompliant
     resources organized by accounts and OUs.</p>
   </li></ul></div>

  
  <h2 id="related-services">How AWS Control Tower interacts with other AWS services</h2>

  <p>AWS Control Tower is built on top of trusted and reliable AWS services including AWS Service Catalog, AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On),
   and AWS Organizations. For more information, see <a href="./integrated-services.html">Integrated services</a>.</p>

  <p>You can incorporate AWS Control Tower with other AWS services into a solution that helps you migrate
   your existing workloads to AWS. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/how-to-take-advantage-of-aws-control-tower-and-cloudendure-to-migrate-workloads-to-aws/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>How to take advantage of AWS Control Tower and CloudEndure to migrate workloads to
   AWS</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>

  <div class="itemizedlist">
   <h6>Configuration, Governance, and Extensibility</h6>
    
    
    
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
    <p><em>Automated account configuration:</em> AWS Control Tower automates
     account deployment and enrollment by means of an Account Factory (or “vending machine”), which
     is built as an abstraction on top of provisioned products in AWS Service Catalog. The Account
     Factory can create and enroll AWS accounts, and it automates the process of applying controls
     and policies to those accounts.</p>
   </li><li class="listitem">
    <p><em>Centralized governance:</em> By employing the capabilities
     of AWS Organizations, AWS Control Tower sets up a framework that ensures consistent compliance and
     governance across your multi-account environment. The AWS Organizations service provides
     essential capabilities for managing a multi-account environment, including central governance
     and management of accounts, account creation from AWS Organizations APIs, and service control policies (SCPs). </p>
    <p></p>
   </li><li class="listitem">
    <p><em>Extensibility:</em> You can build or extend your own
     AWS Control Tower environment by working directly in AWS Organizations, as well as in the AWS Control Tower
     console. You can see your changes reflected in AWS Control Tower after you register your existing
     organizations and enroll your existing accounts into AWS Control Tower. You can update your AWS Control Tower
     landing zone to reflect your changes. If your workloads require further advanced capabilities,
     you can leverage other AWS partner solutions along with AWS Control Tower. </p>
    <p></p>
