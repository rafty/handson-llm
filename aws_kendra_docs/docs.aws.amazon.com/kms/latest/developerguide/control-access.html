    The credentials must include permissions to access AWS resources: <a href="./concepts.html#kms_keys">AWS KMS keys</a> and <a href="./kms-alias.html">aliases</a>. No AWS principal has
    any permissions to a KMS key unless that permission is provided explicitly and never denied.
    There are no implicit or automatic permission to use or manage a KMS key. </p><p>The primary way to manage access to your AWS KMS resources is with
      <em>policies</em>. Policies are documents that describe which principals can
    access which resources. Policies attached to an IAM identity are called
      <em>identity-based policies</em> (or <em>IAM policies</em>), and
    policies attached to other kinds of resources are called <em>resource policies</em>.
    AWS KMS resource policies for KMS keys are called <em>key policies</em>. All
    KMS keys have a key policy.</p><p>To control access to your AWS KMS aliases, use IAM policies. To allow principals to create
    aliases, you must provide the permission to the alias in an IAM policy and permission to the
    key in a key policy. For details, see <a href="./alias-access.html">Controlling access to aliases</a>.</p><p>To control access to your KMS keys, you can use the following policy mechanisms.</p><div class="itemizedlist">
     
     
     
  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
      <p><b>Key policy</b> – Every KMS key has a key policy.
        It is the primary mechanism for controlling access to a KMS key. You can use the key
        policy alone to control access, which means the full scope of access to the KMS key is
        defined in a single document (the key policy). For more information about using key
        policies, see <a href="./key-policies.html">Key policies</a>.</p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p><b>IAM policies</b> – You can use IAM policies in
        combination with the key policy and grants to control access to a KMS key. Controlling
        access this way enables you to manage all of the permissions for your IAM identities in
        IAM. To use an IAM policy to allow access to a KMS key, the key policy must explicitly
        allow it. For more information about using IAM policies, see <a href="./iam-policies.html">IAM policies</a>. </p>
    </li><li class="listitem">
      <p><b>Grants</b> – You can use grants in combination with
        the key policy and IAM policies to allow access to a KMS key. Controlling access this
        way enables you to allow access to the KMS key in the key policy, and to allow identities
        to delegate their access to others. For more information about using grants, see <a href="./grants.html">Grants in AWS KMS</a>.</p>
    </li></ul></div><p>KMS keys belong to the AWS account in which they were created. However, no identity or
    principal, including the AWS account root user, has permission to use or manage a KMS key
    unless that permission is explicitly provided in a key policy, IAM policy or grant. The IAM
    identity who creates a KMS key is not considered to be the key owner and they don't
    automatically have permission to use or manage the KMS key that they created. Like any other
    identity, the key creator needs to get permission through a key policy, IAM policy, or grant.
    However, identities who have the <code class="code">kms:CreateKey</code> permission can set the initial key
    policy and give themselves permission to use or manage the key.</p><p>The following topics

      <h3 id="permission-concept-authentication">Authentication</h3>
      <p><em>Authentication</em> is the process of verifying your
        identity. To send a request to AWS KMS, you must sign into AWS using your AWS
        credentials.</p>
     
    
     
      <h3 id="permission-concept-authorization">Authorization</h3>
      <p><em>Authorization</em> provides the permission to send
        requests to create, manage, or use AWS KMS resources. For example, you must be authorized
        to use a KMS key in a cryptographic operation.</p>
      <p>To control access to your AWS KMS resources, use <a href="./key-policies.html">key
          policies</a>, <a href="./iam-policies.html">IAM policies</a>, and <a href="./grants.html">grants</a>. Every KMS key must have a key policy. If the key policy
        allows it, you can also use IAM policies and grants to give principals access to the
        KMS key. To refine your authorization, you can use <a href="./policy-conditions.html">condition keys</a> that allow or deny access only when a request or resource meets the
        conditions you specify. You can also allow access to principals you trust in <a href="./key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.html">other AWS accounts</a>.</p>
     
    
    
    
     
      <h3 id="security_iam_authentication">Authenticating with identities</h3> 
      
   
<p>Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. You must be
<em>authenticated</em> (signed in to AWS) as the AWS account root user, as an
IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role.</p>

<p>You can sign in to AWS as a federated identity by using credentials provided through an identity source.
AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center) users, your company's single sign-on authentication, and your Google or Facebook
credentials are examples of federated identities. When you sign in as a federated identity, your administrator previously set up identity federation using IAM roles. When you access AWS by using federation, you are indirectly assuming a role.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the AWS access
portal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html">How to sign in to your AWS account</a>
in the <em>AWS Sign-In User Guide</em>.</p>

<p>If you access AWS programmatically, AWS provides a software development kit (SDK) and a
command line interface (CLI) to cryptographically sign your requests using your credentials. If
you don't use AWS tools, you must sign requests yourself. For more information about using the recommended method
to sign requests yourself, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 signing process</a> in
the <em>AWS General Reference</em>.</p>

<p>Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might be required to provide
additional security information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor
authentication (MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.html">Multi-factor authentication</a> in the
<em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html">Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>


   
       
        <h4 id="security_iam_authentication-rootuser">AWS account root user</h4>
        <p>

 When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services
 and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account <em>root user</em> and is accessed by
 signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We 
 strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to
 perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html">Tasks that require root user credentials</a> in the <em>AWS Account Management Reference Guide</em>.
 </p>
       
       
        <h4 id="security_iam_authentication-federated">Federated identity</h4> 
        

<p>As a best practice, require human users, including users that require administrator access, to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS services by using temporary credentials.</p>

<p>A <em>federated identity</em> is a user from your enterprise user directory, a web identity provider, the AWS Directory Service, <span>the Identity Center directory, </span>or any user that
accesses AWS services by using credentials provided through an identity source. When federated identities access AWS accounts, they assume roles, and the roles provide temporary credentials.</p>

<p>For centralized access management, we recommend that you use AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On). You can create users and groups in IAM Identity Center, or you can connect and synchronize 
to a set of users and groups in your own identity source for use across all your AWS accounts and applications. For information 
about IAM Identity Center, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <em>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) User Guide</em>.</p>
 
       
       
        <h4 id="security_iam_authentication-iamuser">IAM users and groups</h4> 
        
   
         <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. However, if you have specific use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate access keys. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials">Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-term credentials</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         
         <p>An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html"><em>IAM group</em></a> is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users.
            You can't sign in as a group. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for
            large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named <em>IAMAdmins</em> and give that group permissions to administer IAM
            resources.</p>
         <p>Users are different from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application, but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone
            who needs it. Users have permanent long-term credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_which-to-choose">When to create an IAM user (instead of a role)</a> in the
               <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
   
       
      
       
        <h4 id="security_iam_authentication-iamrole">IAM roles</h4> 
        
   
         <p>An <em><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a></em> is an identity within your AWS account that
            has specific permissions. It is similar to an IAM user, but is not associated with a specific person. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in
            the AWS Management Console by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html">switching roles</a>. You can assume a role by calling an AWS CLI
            or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information about methods for using roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM roles</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
         <p>IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:</p>

         <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
               <p><b>Federated user access</b> – 

To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role and define permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by the role.

                  access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a
                  resource (instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the difference between
                  roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_compare-resource-policies.html">How IAM roles

      another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To 
      see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awskeymanagementservice.html in the 
      <em>Service Authorization Reference</em>.

      A service role is an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> that a service assumes to perform 
      actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For 
      more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html">Creating a role to delegate permissions

                        <p><b>Service-linked role</b> –

      A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. 
      Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, 
      but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

               <p><b>Applications running on Amazon EC2</b> –

      You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. 
      This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it 
      available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the 
      instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to
      get temporary credentials. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances</a> in the 
      <em>IAM User Guide</em>.

      <h3 id="security_iam_access-manage">Managing access using policies</h3> 
      
   
 <p>You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AWS identities or resources. A policy is an object in AWS that,
 when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal (user, root user, or role session) makes a request. 
 Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. 
 Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about the structure and contents 
 of JSON policy documents, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json">Overview of JSON policies</a> in the 
 <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>

 
   
      <p>Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which <b>principal</b> can perform 
         <b>actions</b> on what <b>resources</b>, and under what <b>conditions</b>.</p>
  

<p>By default, users and roles have no permissions. To grant users permission to perform actions on the resources that they need, an 
IAM administrator can create IAM policies. The administrator can then add the IAM policies to roles, and users can assume the roles.</p>
 <p>IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, suppose that you have a
 policy that allows the <code class="code">iam:GetRole</code> action. A user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS
 API.</p>
   
       
        <h4 id="security_iam_access-manage-id-based-policies">Identity-based
            policies</h4> 
        
   
         
   
         <p>Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These
            policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based
            policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html">Creating IAM policies</a> in the
            <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
  
         <p>Identity-based policies can be further categorized as <em>inline policies</em> or <em>managed
               policies</em>. Inline policies are embedded directly into a single user, group, or role. Managed policies are standalone policies that you
            can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. Managed policies include AWS managed policies and customer managed
            policies. To learn how to choose between a managed policy or an inline policy, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#choosing-managed-or-inline">Choosing between managed policies and inline
               policies</a> in the <em>IAM User Guide</em>.</p>
   
       
       
        <h4 id="security_iam_access-manage-resource-based-policies">Resource-based
            policies</h4> 
        
        <p>An AWS KMS <a href="./key-policies.html">key policy</a> is a resource-based policy
          that controls access to a KMS key. Every KMS key must have a key policy. You can use
          other authorization mechanism to allow access to the KMS key, but only if the key policy
          allows it. (You can use an IAM policy to <em>deny</em> access
          to a KMS key even if the key policy doesn't explicitly permit it.)</p>
        <p>Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource, such
          as a KMS key, to control access to the specific resource. The resource-based policy
          defines the actions that a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what
          conditions. You don't specify the resource in a resource-based policy, but you must
          specify a principal, such as accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.
          Resource-based policies are inline policies that are located in that service that manages
          the resource. You can't use AWS managed policies from IAM, such as the <a href="./aws-managed-policies.html">AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser managed
            policy</a>, in a resource-based policy.</p>
             

       
        <h4 id="security_iam_access-manage-acl">Access control lists (ACLs)</h4> 
        
   
      
   
   <p>Access control lists (ACLs) control which principals (account members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are
            similar to resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format.</p>
  
      <p>Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC
            are examples of services that support ACLs. To learn more about ACLs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access control list (ACL)
               overview</a> in the <em>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</em>.</p>
   
        <p>AWS KMS does not support ACLs.</p>
       
       
        <h4 id="security_iam_access-manage-other-policies">Other policy types</h4> 
        
   
         <p>AWS supports additional, less-common policy types. These policy types can set the maximum permissions granted to you by the more common policy
            types. </p>

                  set a permissions boundary for an entity. The resulting permissions are the
                  intersection of an entity's identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.
                  Resource-based policies that specify the user or role in the
                     <code class="code">Principal</code> field are not limited by the permissions boundary. An
                  explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information

If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to any or all of
                  your accounts. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. For more information about Organizations and

                  permissions are the intersection of the user or role's identity-based policies and
                  the session policies. Permissions can also come from a resource-based policy. An
                  explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information,
